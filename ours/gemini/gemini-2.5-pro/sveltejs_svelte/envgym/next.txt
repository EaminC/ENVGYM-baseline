current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the environment setup, dependency installation, and project build stages (plan steps 1-6). It correctly installs system packages, Node.js dependencies via pnpm, and the required Playwright browser. However, it fails to correctly implement the post-build verification, using a `git commit` workaround instead of ensuring the working directory is clean as specified. The Dockerfile is critically missing the entire testing and validation phase (plan step 7), including linting, formatting checks, type-checking, and running unit and end-to-end tests.

next step
Remove the `git config` and `git commit` steps. The `git status --porcelain` check should run immediately after the `pnpm build` command to correctly enforce that no uncommitted files are generated. Add subsequent `RUN` instructions to execute the complete suite of checks and tests as defined in the plan: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format --check`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm knip`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm test:e2e`.
