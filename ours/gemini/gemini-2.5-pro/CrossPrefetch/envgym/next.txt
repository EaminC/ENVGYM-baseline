current progress
The initial Docker build failed because the `requirements.txt` file could not be found after being copied into the container. The Dockerfile has since been updated to set a final working directory and a default `CMD`, but the root cause of the build failure has not been addressed.

next step
Create the `requirements.txt` file in the project's root directory and populate it with the required Python dependencies to resolve the "file not found" error during the `pip install` step.
