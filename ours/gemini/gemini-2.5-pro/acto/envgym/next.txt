current progress
The Dockerfile successfully automates the complete environment setup as specified in the plan. It installs all system dependencies (Go 1.20.5, Python 3.10, Docker CLI), creates the Python virtual environment with all packages from `requirements-dev.txt`, installs all Kubernetes tooling (`kind`, `kubectl`, `minikube`), and successfully compiles all required Go-based project components (`k8sutil.so`, `libanalysis.so`, `actoFieldCount`). The current image provides a comprehensive, interactive environment where all artifacts are built and ready for use.

next step
Enhance the Dockerfile by adding a build-time verification layer. The current file prepares the environment but does not validate its correctness. The next step is to append a `RUN` command to execute the project's unit tests (e.g., `RUN python3 -m pytest acto`). This will confirm that the core library is functional within the built environment, transitioning the Dockerfile from simply creating an environment to guaranteeing a verified one.
