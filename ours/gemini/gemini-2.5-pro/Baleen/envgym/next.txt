current progress
The initial Dockerfile has been implemented, successfully setting up the Ubuntu base image, system dependencies, and the Micromamba installer. The build process fails during the Conda environment creation step (`micromamba create`). The current Dockerfile deviates from the plan by using a single `COPY . .` instruction, which prevents effective use of Docker's layer caching.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to align with the more efficient structure outlined in the plan. Split the `COPY` instruction into two parts: first, copy only the Conda environment file (`COPY BCacheSim/install/env_cachelib-py-3.11.yaml .`), then execute the `micromamba create` command. After the environment is successfully created, add a second `COPY . .` instruction to copy the rest of the application code.
