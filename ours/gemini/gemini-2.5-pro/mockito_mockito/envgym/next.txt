current progress
The Dockerfile successfully installs all planned prerequisites, including Git, JDK 21, and the Android SDK with the necessary components (platforms, emulator, system images). It also correctly sets environment variables and clones the Mockito source code repository. The process fails at the project verification step, where the `RUN ./gradlew build` command exits with an error, preventing the build from completing. Subsequent steps, such as creating a new test file, have not been attempted.

next step
The `./gradlew build` command is failing, and the log lacks a specific error message. To isolate the problem, replace the comprehensive `build` task with a more fundamental one that skips the tests. Modify the failing line to run `./gradlew assemble` instead. This will determine if the failure is in the compilation phase or the test execution phase. Change the Dockerfile line from `RUN ./gradlew build --stacktrace -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs="-Xmx2048m"` to `RUN ./gradlew assemble --stacktrace -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs="-Xmx2048m"`.
