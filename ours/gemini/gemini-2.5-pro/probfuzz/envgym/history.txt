=== Iteration 1 - [2025-08-29 09:34:35] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created that automates the first four steps of the setup plan: system tool installation, Java installation, Python deep learning framework installation, and execution of the main project installation script. The previous build attempt failed during the initial system package installation (Step 1). The current Dockerfile correctly implements the command for this step as specified in the plan, but has not yet been tested. The Dockerfile currently concludes by providing an interactive shell, leaving the final validation steps (Steps 5-7) to be performed manually.
  next step
  Incorporate the plan's verification steps (Steps 5, 6, and 7) directly into the Dockerfile as `RUN` commands after the `./install.sh` instruction. This will automate the end-to-end validation process, ensuring that the Docker image build will only succeed if the initial test run, metric script execution, and summary report generation complete without errors. This involves adding `RUN ./probfuzz.py 1` and subsequent `RUN` commands for the metric and summary scripts.

=== Iteration 2 - [2025-08-29 09:36:14] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile setup has been implemented up to Step 2 of the plan. The build is currently failing at the execution of `./install_java.sh` with `exit code: 127`, which typically indicates a "command not found" error. This could be caused by incorrect line endings in the script (e.g., CRLF instead of LF) or the script's specified interpreter (shebang) not being available. A `chmod` command has been correctly added to ensure scripts are executable. The subsequent verification steps (Steps 6 and 7) are present in the Dockerfile but are implemented incorrectly, as they lack the necessary command-line arguments specified in the plan, which will cause them to fail once the current issue is resolved.
  next step
  1.  **Diagnose and fix the `install_java.sh` script failure.** Before the `RUN ./install_java.sh` line, insert a command to inspect the script and correct potential issues. Install `dos2unix` to fix line endings and print the script's first line to verify its interpreter.
      *   **Modify Dockerfile:** Add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y dos2unix && dos2unix ./*.sh && head -n 1 ./install_java.sh` before the script execution line.
  2.  **Correct the implementation of verification steps.** Modify the `RUN` commands for Steps 5, 6, and 7 to match the plan. The test run, metric script execution, and summary generation must be chained together in a single `RUN` command to ensure the output from one step is available as input for the next. The metric and summary scripts must be called with the correct arguments as specified in the plan.
      *   **Modify Dockerfile:** Replace the separate `RUN` commands for Steps 5, 6, and 7 with a single, chained command like:
          ```dockerfile
          RUN /bin/bash -c './probfuzz.py 1 && metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan && ./probfuzz.py 5 && ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape'
          ```

=== Iteration 3 - [2025-08-29 09:38:04] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Docker build process successfully completes Step 1 of the plan by installing all prerequisite system tools, including `python2` and `pip`. The build fails at the beginning of Step 2, when attempting to execute the `./install_java.sh` script. The log shows `exit code: 127`, which indicates the command could not be found or executed by the shell (`/bin/sh`). This suggests a problem with the script's interpreter (shebang line) or execution environment, even though `chmod` and `dos2unix` have already been applied.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to explicitly use `/bin/bash` to run the installation script, which is more robust than the default `/bin/sh` and will resolve potential shebang or shell-specific syntax issues. Add a diagnostic command before the `RUN` instruction to verify the script's permissions and content.
  Replace the line `RUN ./install_java.sh` with the following:
  ```dockerfile
  # Add diagnostic commands to verify file permissions and the shebang line
  RUN ls -l ./install_java.sh && head -n 1 ./install_java.sh
  # Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script using bash for better compatibility
  RUN /bin/bash ./install_java.sh
  ```

=== Iteration 4 - [2025-08-29 09:38:42] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The previous Docker build failed during the execution of the Java installation script (`install_java.sh`) with `exit code: 127`, indicating a "command not found" error. The current Dockerfile has been updated to specifically address this failure by adding `dos2unix` to correct potential script line-ending issues and `chmod +x` to ensure all shell scripts are executable. The Dockerfile now also includes diagnostic checks for file permissions and shebang lines and proceeds with the full installation and verification plan outlined in the project requirements.
  next step
  Execute the updated Dockerfile to build the image. The primary objective is to confirm that the changes have resolved the `exit code: 127` error during the Java installation. If this step succeeds, closely monitor the build log for any new errors that may arise during the subsequent Python framework installation, main script execution (`install.sh`), or the final test run sequence.

=== Iteration 5 - [2025-08-29 09:41:08] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                    ]
                }
                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:
          ```json
          {
              "models": [

          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been substantially revised to address the previous build failure. The root cause of the `exit code: 127` error, likely related to script permissions or line endings, has been addressed by adding `chmod +x` and `dos2unix` commands. The fragile `install_java.sh` script has been replaced with a direct and more reliable installation of `openjdk-8-jdk` via `apt`. The Dockerfile now correctly implements all installation steps from the plan (System Tools, Java, DL Frameworks, Main Install Script) and integrates the final verification and test run steps (5, 6, and 7) into the build process itself.
  next step
  Execute the Docker build using the current Dockerfile. The objective is to confirm that the implemented fixes resolve the previous `install.sh` failure and to validate that the entire environment setup, including the final chained test run, completes successfully as specified in the plan.

=== Iteration 6 - [2025-08-29 09:43:30] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:

                ]
            }
          }

          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created based on the adjusted plan, using `ubuntu:20.04` as the base image. The implementation correctly adapts to the Ubuntu 20.04 environment by replacing the plan's custom Java installation script with a more reliable `apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk` and by using `get-pip.py` to install `pip` for Python 2. The previous build attempt failed during the `apt-get install` step, likely because the package names in the plan (`python2.7`, `python-pip`) are not directly available in this OS version. The current Dockerfile attempts to fix this by installing the `python2` package but may be incomplete. Verification steps from the plan have been consolidated into the build process for automated testing.
  next step
  Modify the `RUN apt-get install` command in the Dockerfile to ensure all necessary build dependencies are met and to be more explicit, which will prevent potential compilation errors during the `pip install` phase. Change the package `python2` to `python2.7` and `python2.7-dev`. The `python2.7-dev` package is critical as it provides the necessary header files for `build-essential` to compile Python C extensions required by libraries like `pystan`. The corrected command should install `python2.7`, `python2.7-dev`, and the other system dependencies in a single layer.

--- End of Iteration 6 ---

=== Iteration 7 - [2025-08-29 09:45:16] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json
          {

  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been updated to successfully install base system dependencies, Python 2.7, and pip, resolving the previous `apt-get` build failure. It correctly installs the specified CPU versions of PyTorch (0.4.0) and TensorFlow (1.5.0) and executes the main `./install.sh` script. However, it deviates from the plan in two key areas: it installs OpenJDK 8 instead of the specified Oracle Java 8, and it combines all verification steps (Steps 5-7) into a single `RUN` command, which is less robust for validation than the planned sequential checks.
  next step
  1.  Align the Java installation with the plan. Replace the `apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk` command and related `ENV` variables with `RUN ./install_java.sh` to install the required Oracle Java 8.
  2.  Decompose the single verification `RUN` layer into multiple distinct `RUN` commands to match the plan's sequential validation logic (Steps 5, 6, and 7). This improves build caching, simplifies debugging, and ensures the summary script correctly targets only the output from the multi-iteration run. An example sequence would be:
      ```dockerfile
      # Step 5: Initial Test Run
      RUN ./probfuzz.py 1
      # Step 6: Verify Metric Scripts
      RUN metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan && \
          metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward && \
          metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
      # Step 7: Full Run & Summary
      RUN ./probfuzz.py 5
      RUN ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
      ```

--- End of Iteration 7 ---

=== Iteration 8 - [2025-08-29 09:46:52] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:
          ```json

          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  A comprehensive environment setup plan has been defined. A Dockerfile has been created to automate this plan, incorporating steps for system dependency installation, Java setup, Python framework installation, and execution of project-specific scripts and tests. The most recent Docker build failed at the initial `RUN` command responsible for installing system packages via `apt-get`. The provided build log confirms the point of failure but does not include the specific error message, preventing a precise diagnosis.
  next step
  Modify the initial `RUN` command in the Dockerfile to ensure the `apt-get` operation is successful. The failure is likely because the `python2.7` package resides in the "universe" repository, which needs to be explicitly enabled in Ubuntu 20.04. The command should be updated to first install `software-properties-common`, then add the `universe` repository, and finally install the complete list of required packages, all within a single `RUN` layer to maintain build efficiency.

=== Iteration 9 - [2025-08-29 09:48:21] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:
          ```json
          {
              "models": [

          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The previous Docker build failed during the initial system package installation. A new, comprehensive Dockerfile has been developed that fully implements all 7 steps of the adjusted setup plan. This new file introduces critical fixes that likely resolve the prior failure, such as adding the 'universe' repository to locate `python2.7` and implementing a more robust manual installation for `pip`. The Dockerfile now represents a complete and logical translation of the setup plan into an automated build process, but it remains untested.
  next step
  To systematically debug the build, modify the Dockerfile by commenting out the final application execution and testing layers (Steps 5, 6, and 7). This change isolates the environment setup phase (dependency installation) from the functional validation phase. First, confirm that a stable image containing all required tools and libraries can be built successfully. Once the setup is verified, re-enable the commented-out `RUN` commands to test the end-to-end functionality within the image build process.

=== Iteration 10 - [2025-08-29 09:49:35] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*

  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The previous Docker build failure, which occurred during the system package installation phase, has been addressed. The current Dockerfile now correctly adds the `universe` repository to locate `python2.7` on Ubuntu 20.04 and includes a robust installation method for `pip`. All software installation steps outlined in the plan (system tools, Java, Python deep learning frameworks, and project dependencies via `install.sh`) have been implemented. The validation steps (5, 6, and 7) are present but commented out, indicating the build phase is complete and ready for testing.
  next step
  Build the current Dockerfile to confirm that all installation layers complete successfully. After the build succeeds, validate the environment's functionality by sequentially uncommenting the test steps. First, uncomment Step 5 (`RUN ./probfuzz.py 1`) to perform an initial integration test. If that passes, uncomment and run Step 6 and Step 7 to verify the full analysis and reporting pipeline.

=== Iteration 11 - [2025-08-29 09:50:53] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                    ]
                }
                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been updated to implement the setup plan through Step 5 (Initial Test Run), including robust installation of system tools, Python 2, pip, Java, and required Python frameworks. The previous build failed during the initial system package installation. The current Dockerfile attempts to resolve this and proceeds through the main installation script and an initial test run. Steps 6 and 7 of the plan are present in the Dockerfile but are currently commented out for incremental validation.
  next step
  Execute the Docker build with the current Dockerfile to confirm that the environment setup and the initial test run (`./probfuzz.py 1`) complete successfully. If the build is successful, uncomment the lines for Step 6 (`metrics/mlr_smape.sh ...`) to validate the metric script execution in the next build.

=== Iteration 12 - [2025-08-29 09:52:43] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:
          ```json

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The project is in the initial environment setup phase, corresponding to "Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools" of the plan. An automated Docker build was attempted based on the provided `Dockerfile`. The build failed during the execution of the `apt-get install` command, which is responsible for installing system-level dependencies like Python 2.7 and build tools.
  next step
  Modify the `Dockerfile` to fix the system package installation failure. Replace the multi-line `RUN` command for `apt-get` with a single, consolidated command that aligns with the plan. The new command should combine the installation of all packages (`software-properties-common`, `python2.7`, `build-essential`, etc.) into one `apt-get install` call after enabling the `universe` repository, which is necessary for Python 2 on Ubuntu 20.04. This simplifies the Docker layer and directly follows the plan's structure.

=== Iteration 13 - [2025-08-29 09:55:07] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup based on the provided plan, using `ubuntu:20.04` as the base. It correctly identifies and attempts to install system-level dependencies, including legacy Python 2 packages. The previous build attempt failed during this initial package installation phase. The current Dockerfile has been updated to include the `universe` repository, which is the correct strategy to locate deprecated packages like `python2.7` and `python-pip` on this OS version. Steps for installing Java, Python frameworks, and executing the project's installation and test scripts are also staged.
  next step
  Consolidate the system package installation into a single, atomic `RUN` command. This aligns with the plan's structure and Docker best practices, reducing image layers and improving clarity. The command should chain all actions together: `apt-get update`, installing `software-properties-common`, adding the `universe` repository, updating again, installing all required packages (including `python2.7-dev` and `dos2unix`), and finally upgrading `pip`. This ensures the entire system prerequisite setup either succeeds or fails as a single unit, making it easier to debug.

=== Iteration 14 - [2025-08-29 09:56:28] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:

          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup according to the plan. A previous build attempt failed during the system dependency installation phase (Plan Step 1). The current Dockerfile contains a modified `apt-get` command, which adds the `universe` repository, in an attempt to fix this failure. Subsequent installation steps for Java (Step 2), Python frameworks (Step 3), the main installation script (Step 4), and an initial test run (Step 5) have been implemented. The final validation steps (6 and 7) are included but commented out, awaiting the successful build of the base environment.
  next step
  Execute a Docker build using the current Dockerfile to verify if the modified `apt-get` command resolves the initial build failure. If the build completes successfully through the initial test run (Step 5), the next action is to uncomment the lines for Step 6 (Verify Metric Scripts) and Step 7 (Full Run & Summary) and rebuild the image to perform the final end-to-end validation. If the build fails again, analyze the `apt-get` error and consider simplifying the command to precisely match the one specified in the plan's Step 1.

=== Iteration 15 - [2025-08-29 09:57:55] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json
          {
            "max_threads": 1,
            "output_dir": "output",

  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully implements the first five steps of the automated setup plan. System dependencies, Java, required Python frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and project-specific packages from `install.sh` are correctly installed. The build now includes the initial test run (`./probfuzz.py 1`), which validates that the core program generation functionality is working. The final two validation stages, metric script verification (Step 6) and the full summary run (Step 7), are present in the Dockerfile but are currently commented out.
  next step
  Uncomment and implement the metric script verification (Step 6). To improve build efficiency and ensure the test output is available for validation, combine the initial test run (Step 5) and metric script verification (Step 6) into a single `RUN` instruction. This involves executing `./probfuzz.py 1` and then immediately running the three `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` commands on the generated output within the same layer.

=== Iteration 16 - [2025-08-29 09:58:31] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json
          {

  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been updated to address a previous build failure during the system package installation. It now successfully implements the first six steps of the adjusted plan: installing system tools, executing the Java and main installation scripts, installing specific versions of CPU-based deep learning frameworks (PyTorch and TensorFlow), and performing an initial test run with metric script verification. Step 7, the full summary run, is currently commented out.
  next step
  Modify the `RUN apt-get install` command to include the `software-properties-common` package. This change is required to fully align the Dockerfile with Step 1 of the adjusted plan, which lists this package as a core build tool.

=== Iteration 17 - [2025-08-29 09:59:12] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:

  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile implementation of the adjusted plan is failing at the first step: system package installation. The build log indicates an error during the `apt-get install` command. The root cause is an incompatibility between the required Python 2 packages (specifically `python2.7` and `python-pip`) and the chosen `ubuntu:20.04` base image, which has deprecated native support for Python 2. Subsequent steps in the plan, such as Java installation and Python library setup, have not been reached.
  next step
  Modify the first line of the Dockerfile to switch the base image to one with full native support for the required Python 2 dependencies. Change `FROM ubuntu:20.04` to `FROM ubuntu:18.04`. This will resolve the package installation failure and allow the Docker build to proceed to the next steps of the setup plan.

--- End of Iteration 17 ---

=== Iteration 18 - [2025-08-29 10:00:17] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json

                    ]
                }
                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:

          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been set up to follow the automated installation plan. It successfully installs system-level dependencies, copies project files, and corrects script permissions and line endings. The build process currently fails at Step 2 of the plan, "Execute the Java Installation Script". The log shows the command `RUN ./install_java.sh` fails with `exit code: 127`, which indicates that a command executed *within* the `install_java.sh` script cannot be found by the shell.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to diagnose the script failure. Change the line `RUN ./install_java.sh` to `RUN /bin/sh -x ./install_java.sh`. This will execute the script in debug mode, printing each command before it is run. Re-run the Docker build and analyze the output to identify the specific command within `install_java.sh` that is causing the "command not found" error, and then correct the script or add the missing dependency to the Dockerfile.

--- End of Iteration 18 ---

=== Iteration 19 - [2025-08-29 10:00:56] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile automation of the setup plan is partially complete. It successfully installs base system dependencies (Step 1), copies project files, and applies necessary permissions. However, the build fails during Step 2, the execution of the Java installation script (`install_java.sh`). The log's `exit code: 127` indicates a "command not found" error is occurring within the script, which prevents the Java environment from being set up and blocks all subsequent installation steps.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to replace the execution of the problematic `install_java.sh` script. Instead, install a compatible Java 8 environment directly using the system's package manager. Replace the line `RUN /bin/sh -x ./install_java.sh` with a standard command to install OpenJDK 8, such as `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk --no-install-recommends`. This provides a more reliable and transparent method for fulfilling the Java dependency.

=== Iteration 20 - [2025-08-29 10:02:12] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware information, the environment setup plan has been adjusted for compatibility, feasibility, and to align with best practices for automated or containerized builds. The core software stack remains the same due to project requirements, but the installation and verification procedures have been refined.
  Here is the complete adjusted plan:
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  **DOWNLOADS NEEDED:**
      *   **Operating System**: An `amd64/x86_64` Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04) is required.
      *   **Source Code Control**: Git, for initial project setup.
      *   **Core Build Tools**: `build-essential`, `bc`, `wget`, `software-properties-common`, `ca-certificates`.
      *   **Programming Language**: Python 2.7.
      *   **Java Development Kit**: Oracle Java 8. This is a runtime dependency for the ANTLR parser generator.
      *   **Python Package Manager**: `pip` for Python 2.
      *   **Parser Generator**: ANTLR v4.7.1 (`antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar`), which will be downloaded by the installation script.
      *   **Probabilistic Programming Systems (PPS) and Libraries**: The installation scripts will install these specific versions, ensuring they are CPU-compatible as no GPU is available.
          *   **Stan**: Python interface `pystan`.
          *   **Edward**: The `edward` library.
          *   **TensorFlow**: Version `1.5.0` (CPU version, dependency for Edward).
          *   **Pyro**: Version `0.2.1` (`pyro-ppl`).
          *   **PyTorch**: Version `0.4.0` (**CPU version**, dependency for Pyro).
          *   **Other Python Libraries**: `antlr4-python2-runtime`, `six`, `astunparse`, `ast`, `pandas`, `scipy`.
      *   **Project Source Code**: The Probfuzz project repository, which includes all necessary scripts and configuration templates.
  2.  **PREREQUISITE PROJECT FILES:**
      The following files must exist in the project's source directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz`) before initiating the setup. In a containerized build, these files will be copied into the environment, not created within it.
      *   **`.gitignore`**: Located in the project root, this file ensures that generated output and caches are not tracked by Git. Content:
          ```
          output/
          __pycache__/
          *.pyc
          .idea/*
          *~
          ```
      *   **`language/antlr/.gitignore`**: Located in `language/antlr/`, this file prevents ANTLR-generated parser files from being tracked. Content:
          ```
          *.java
          *.tokens
          *.interp
          *.py
          ```
      *   **`config.json`**: Located in the project root, this file controls the tool's runtime behavior. Content:
          ```json
          {

                    ]
                }
                ]
            }
          }
          ```
      *   **`language/stanmodels.json`**: Located in the `language/` directory, this file defines statistical distributions and inference configurations. Content:
          ```json
          {
              "models": [

                          }
                      ],

          }
          ```
          *(Note: The full content of `stanmodels.json` from the original plan should be used here; it is truncated for brevity.)*
  3.  **NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:**
      These tests are used to validate the environment after the setup is complete. They should be run from within the configured environment (e.g., inside the Docker container).
      *   **Java Runtime Environment Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure Oracle Java 8 is correctly installed.
          *   **Verification**: Execute `java -version`. The output must include `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Installation Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `install.sh` completed successfully.
          *   **Verification**: Use `pip2 list` to confirm `tensorflow==1.5.0`, `pyro-ppl==0.2.1`, `torch==0.4.0`, and other required libraries are installed. Check that the script's final `./check.py` step (if present) completed without error.
      *   **ANTLR Parser Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm ANTLR parser files were generated.
          *   **Verification**: The directory `language/antlr/` must contain `TemplateLexer.py`, `TemplateParser.py`, `TemplateVisitor.py`, and `__init__.py`.
      *   **Configuration Loading Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Ensure `probfuzz.py` correctly parses configuration files.
          *   **Verification**: Temporarily modify `config.json` to set `"enabled": false` for the "stan" tool. Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Verify that Stan-related files are not generated, then revert the change.
      *   **Program Generation Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify that `probfuzz.py` can generate a valid program set.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check that the directory `output/progs.../prob_rand_1` is created and contains `model.stan`, `edward_prog.py`, and `pyro_prog.py`.
      *   **Differential Testing Output Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Confirm output files are generated in the correct format.
          *   **Verification**: Run `./probfuzz.py 1`. Check for the existence and format of `pplout_*`, `edwardout_*`, and `pyroout_*`.
      *   **MLR Model Metric Script Execution Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify the `metrics/mlr_smape.sh` script can parse outputs.
          *   **Verification**: After a successful run, execute `metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan`. The script should print a numerical value. Repeat for `edward` and `pyro`.
      *   **Results Summary Script Test**:
          *   **Objective**: Verify `summary.sh` can generate a summary report.
          *   **Verification**: After a multi-program run (`./probfuzz.py 5`), execute `./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape`. The script should produce a valid CSV output to the console.
  4.  **COMPLETE TODO LIST (AUTOMATED SETUP):**
      This sequence of steps is designed for an automated build process, such as a Dockerfile, within the `x86_64` architecture. All commands are executed from the project's root directory (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/probfuzz` or the `WORKDIR` in a container). `sudo` is not used as commands are run with root privileges in this context.
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisite System Tools**
          *   **Action**: Update package lists and install essential system-level dependencies in a non-interactive way.
          *   **Command**: `apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends git build-essential python2.7 python-pip bc wget software-properties-common ca-certificates`
          *   **Verification**: Run `python2.7 --version` and `pip --version` to ensure they are installed correctly.
      *   **Step 2: Execute the Java Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the script to install the Oracle Java 8 JDK. The script must be executable and capable of running non-interactively.
          *   **Command**: `./install_java.sh`
          *   **Verification**: Run `java -version`; the output should contain `java version "1.8.0_..."`.
      *   **Step 3: Install Python Deep Learning Frameworks (CPU-Specific)**
          *   **Action**: Install the specific CPU-only versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow required by the project. This is critical as no GPU is available.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              pip2 install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html
              pip2 install tensorflow==1.5.0
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Run `pip2 list | grep -E "torch|tensorflow"` and confirm the versions are `0.4.0` and `1.5.0` respectively.
      *   **Step 4: Execute the Main Installation Script**
          *   **Action**: Run the main script to install all remaining software dependencies (like `pystan`, `edward`, `pyro-ppl`) and generate the ANTLR parser files.
          *   **Command**: `./install.sh`
          *   **Verification**: The script should complete without errors. Check for the existence of `language/antlr/TemplateParser.py`. Run `pip2 list` to confirm all required Python packages are present.
      *   **Step 5: Perform an Initial Test Run**
          *   **Action**: Run the Probfuzz tool for a single iteration to ensure the entire pipeline is functional.
          *   **Command**: `./probfuzz.py 1`
          *   **Verification**: The script should exit with code 0. An `output` directory containing a program subdirectory (e.g., `progs.../prob_rand_1`) should be created.
      *   **Step 6: Verify Metric Script Functionality**
          *   **Action**: Execute the metric script against the generated output for each PPS to ensure result parsing is correct. Note that the `progs*` glob may need to be adjusted based on the exact directory name created.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 stan
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 edward
              metrics/mlr_smape.sh output/progs*/prob_rand_1 pyro
              ```
          *   **Verification**: Each command should execute successfully and output a single numerical value.
      *   **Step 7: Perform a Full Example Run and Summarize**
          *   **Action**: Execute a multi-iteration run and use the summary script to generate a consolidated report. This validates the end-to-end workflow.
          *   **Commands**:
              ```bash
              ./probfuzz.py 5
              ./summary.sh -d output/progs* -m mlr_smape
              ```
          *   **Verification**: The `summary.sh` script should print a CSV-formatted table to the console with a header row and five data rows, confirming that the analysis and reporting tools are working correctly. The environment is now fully configured and validated.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been updated to align with the automated setup plan. It now installs system dependencies, Python 2.7, and project files. It attempts to install the specified CPU versions of PyTorch (0.4.0) and TensorFlow (1.5.0). However, the previous build failed due to a missing `setuptools` Python module during the TensorFlow installation. The current Dockerfile deviates from the plan by installing OpenJDK 8 via `apt-get` instead of executing the prescribed `./install_java.sh` script for Oracle Java 8.
  next step
  1.  Add `python-setuptools` to the initial `apt-get install` command to explicitly resolve the `ImportError: No module named setuptools` that caused the previous build failure.
  2.  Replace the `apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk` command with the `RUN ./install_java.sh` command to adhere to Step 2 of the plan, which requires Oracle Java 8.
  3.  Combine the two separate `apt-get` installation blocks into a single `RUN` instruction to optimize the image build by reducing the number of layers.
