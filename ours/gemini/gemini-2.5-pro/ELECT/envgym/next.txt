current progress
A comprehensive Dockerfile has been created to automate the build environment setup based on the provided plan. The Dockerfile successfully installs Java and Python prerequisites, creates the specified `cc` user, clones the required `cassandra-dtest` repository, and scripts the build process for all components including the native library, the ELECT prototype, Python libraries, the object storage backend, and the YCSB tool. However, the previous build attempt failed during the `apt-get install` step for build tools (ant, maven, etc.), with an exit code of 100, indicating a package installation error.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to improve the reliability of package installation by consolidating all `apt-get install` commands into a single `RUN` layer. This layer should chain the `apt-get update`, the installation of all system packages (Java, build tools, Python, utilities), and the final `apt-get clean` command. This ensures a fresh package index is used for all installations and directly addresses the cause of the `exit code: 100` failure.
