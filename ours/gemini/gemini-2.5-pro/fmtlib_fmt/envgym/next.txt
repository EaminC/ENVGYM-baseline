current progress
The Dockerfile successfully provisions a comprehensive development environment based on the plan. It installs all specified dependencies, including compilers (GCC, Clang), build systems (CMake, Ninja, Bazel), Android tools (SDK/NDK), documentation generators (Doxygen, MkDocs), and CI tools (`act`). The environment is pre-configured by cloning the {fmt} source code and running an initial CMake build, which fetches test dependencies, making it ready for immediate compilation and testing tasks.

next step
To fully align with the plan's "OPTION E", modify the Dockerfile to complete the local fuzzing setup. Add a `RUN` instruction to clone the `google/oss-fuzz` repository into the `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/` directory. This will ensure the OSS-Fuzz framework is available within the container, making the environment fully prepared for the specified fuzzing workflows.
