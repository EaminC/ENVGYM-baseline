current progress
The Dockerfile successfully automates the creation of a complete development environment as specified in the plan. It installs all required system-level dependencies (Node.js 22, Python, Git, Vercel CLI, GitHub CLI), clones the repository, installs project dependencies via npm, and creates the necessary placeholder `.env` file. The container provides an interactive shell, making the environment ready for a developer to begin work.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile's final instruction from `CMD ["/bin/bash"]` to `CMD ["vercel", "dev"]`. This will change the container's default behavior from launching an interactive shell to automatically starting the local development server, which is the primary action a developer would take after setup is complete, as indicated by the plan.
