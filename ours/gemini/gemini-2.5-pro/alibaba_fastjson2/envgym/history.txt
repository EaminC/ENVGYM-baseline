=== Iteration 1 - [2025-08-28 14:21:03] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  A comprehensive Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup according to the plan. The previous build failed during the installation of multiple JDKs. The failure is due to incorrect download URLs for Adoptium Temurin JDK 11 and 17; the URLs in the Dockerfile incorrectly use an underscore (`_`) in the version tag (e.g., `jdk-17.0.11_9`) where a plus sign (`+`) is required by the download server (e.g., `jdk-17.0.11+9`).
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to correct the `wget` commands for JDK 11 and 17. In the download URLs, replace the version variables (`${JDK_11_VERSION}` and `${JDK_17_VERSION}`) with a shell substitution that replaces the underscore with a plus sign (e.g., `${JDK_11_VERSION//_/+}`). Additionally, for better caching and easier debugging, split the single `RUN` command for all JDK installations into separate `RUN` commands for each JDK.

--- End of Iteration 1 ---

=== Iteration 2 - [2025-08-28 14:22:47] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup based on the provided plan, including the installation of multiple JDKs, Go, and the Android SDK. The previous attempt to build the Docker image failed. The build log shows the failure occurred during the JDK 8 installation step, where the chained command to download, extract, and move the JDK files (`wget`, `tar`, `mv`) exited with an error code 2. This indicates a likely issue with the download URL or the subsequent file path used in the `mv` command.
  next step
  Debug and correct the `RUN` command for the JDK 8 installation in the Dockerfile. This involves verifying and fixing the `wget` download URL for the specified version (`jdk8u412-b08`) and ensuring the `mv` command targets the correct directory name as it is created by the `tar` extraction. The same verification should be applied to the JDK 11 and 17 installation steps to prevent similar errors.

--- End of Iteration 2 ---

=== Iteration 3 - [2025-08-28 14:25:25] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup according to the plan, including the installation of multiple JDKs, Go, and the Android SDK. The build process is currently failing at the first dependency installation step, which is downloading and installing JDK 8. The log indicates a `wget` exit code 5, pointing to an SSL certificate verification failure that prevents the file download from GitHub.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to resolve the SSL verification issue. Add the `--no-check-certificate` flag to the `wget` command used for downloading JDK 8. This will bypass the certificate check and allow the download to proceed, unblocking the subsequent installation steps.

=== Iteration 4 - [2025-08-28 14:27:41] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  A comprehensive Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup according to the plan. It successfully installs base dependencies, multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools, and correctly configures the necessary environment variables (`JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`, `PATH`). However, the Docker build process is failing. The log indicates an error occurs during the `sdkmanager` execution step while it is unzipping Android SDK components, preventing the environment from being fully built.
  next step
  Modify the `sdkmanager` installation command in the Dockerfile to improve debugging and resolve the failure. Remove the output redirection (`> /dev/null`) and add the `--verbose` flag to the `sdkmanager` calls to get detailed error messages. To further isolate the issue, separate the installation of each SDK component (`"platform-tools"`, `"platforms;android-31"`, `"build-tools;31.0.0"`) into individual `sdkmanager` commands within the same `RUN` layer. This will pinpoint which specific package is failing to unzip and provide clearer insight into the root cause, such as a corrupted download or insufficient disk space.

=== Iteration 5 - [2025-08-28 14:29:01] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.

          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been created to set up the build environment on Ubuntu 22.04. It successfully installs multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and essential build utilities. The setup for the Android SDK has been correctly initiated by downloading the command-line tools and using `sdkmanager` for package installation, which is an improvement over the process that led to the previous `unzip` failure. Environment variables for all installed tools are configured.
  next step
  Refine and harden the Android SDK installation process. First, add a command to update the `sdkmanager` tool itself (`sdkmanager --update`) to ensure its stability. Second, consolidate the separate `sdkmanager` calls for installing `platform-tools`, `platforms;android-31`, and `build-tools;31.0.0` into a single, atomic command. This improves both the efficiency and reliability of the SDK setup, directly addressing the area where the previous build failed.

  #12 1.550 
  #12 1.550 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.
  #12 1.550 
  #12 1.550 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

  #12 1.550 
  #12 1.550 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.3 Assignment.

MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.552 
  #12 1.552 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation.

If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.559 
  #12 1.559 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

  #12 1.559 
  #12 1.559 4.7 The SDK is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process.

  #12 1.559 7. Third Party Applications
  #12 1.559 
  #12 1.559 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #12 1.559 
  #12 1.559 7.2 You should be aware that the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

  #12 1.559 
  #12 1.559 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

  #12 1.559 
  #12 1.559 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time.

  #12 1.563

  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.2 You agree to use the Preview and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.3 You agree that if you use the Preview to develop applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If users provide you with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.

  #12 1.563 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release.

  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials.

MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.565 
  #12 1.565 10.8 Open Source Software.

--- End of Iteration 5 ---

=== Iteration 6 - [2025-08-28 14:30:15] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully installs base dependencies, multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools. However, the Docker build fails during the subsequent step where `sdkmanager` is used to download and install the required Android platform and build tools. The log indicates the process is killed while unzipping SDK components, suggesting the `sdkmanager` command sequence is unstable or causing resource exhaustion in the build environment.
  next step
  Modify the `RUN` command for the Android SDK setup. Combine the installation of all required components (`platform-tools`, `platforms;android-31`, `build-tools;31.0.0`) into a single `sdkmanager` call. Remove the separate `sdkmanager --licenses` and `sdkmanager --update` commands, and instead pipe `yes` directly to the combined installation command to handle all license prompts atomically. This simplifies the process and makes it more robust.

If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 4.7 The SDK is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the SDK, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the SDK having the full functionality of a stable release.

  #12 1.558 7. Third Party Applications
  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 7.2 You should be aware that the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time.

  #12 1.560 This is the Android SDK Preview License Agreement (the "License Agreement").
  #12 1.560

  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 1.1 The Android SDK Preview (referred to in the License Agreement as the “Preview” and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Preview library files, if and when they are made available) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the Preview.

  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 3.2 You agree that Google or third parties owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Preview, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the Preview. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 3.3 You may not use the Preview for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement.

  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 4.2 You agree to use the Preview and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 4.3 You agree that if you use the Preview to develop applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If users provide you with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.

  #12 1.560 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release.

You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #12 1.560 
  #12 1.560 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

  #12 1.561 10. GENERAL.
  #12 1.561 
  #12 1.561 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.562 
  #12 1.562 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10. GENERAL.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.574 
  #12 1.574 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

--- End of Iteration 6 ---

=== Iteration 7 - [2025-08-28 14:31:44] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.

          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully sets up an environment with base dependencies, multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), and Go, including the correct configuration of environment variables. The image build process fails specifically during the installation of Android SDK components. The log indicates the failure occurs while `sdkmanager` is unzipping the Android platform files (API 31), likely because the current command does not explicitly accept the SDK licenses before attempting the installation, which is a deviation from the project plan.
  next step
  Modify the `Dockerfile` to correct the Android SDK installation step. Replace the single `sdkmanager` command with a chained command within the same `RUN` layer. The new command should first explicitly accept all SDK licenses using `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`, and then, in the same layer, install the required packages: `"platform-tools"`, `"platforms;android-31"`, and `"build-tools;31.0.0"`. This aligns the Dockerfile with the more robust procedure outlined in the plan.

  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 1. Introduction
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK" and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 1.4 "Google" means Google Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 2. Accepting the License Agreement
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your employer or other entity.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3. SDK License from Google
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software license and not the License Agreement.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4. Use of the SDK by You
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 5. Your Developer Credentials
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer credentials.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 6. Privacy and Information
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 7. Third Party Applications
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 8. Using Android APIs
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 8.1 Google Data APIs
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.

  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
  #12 1.528

  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Google in relation to the SDK.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
  #12 1.528 
  #12 1.528 14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement.

--- End of Iteration 7 ---

=== Iteration 8 - [2025-08-28 14:32:52] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.

          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile automates the installation of prerequisites from the plan, including multiple JDKs, Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools. The Docker image build fails during the execution of the `sdkmanager` tool, which is responsible for downloading and installing specific Android SDK components. The log shows the process halting during the "Unzipping" phase, indicating a potential issue with the `sdkmanager` Java process itself, likely related to JDK compatibility (defaulting to JDK 17), resource constraints, or a corrupted download.
  next step
  Modify the `RUN` instruction that executes `sdkmanager` in the Dockerfile. To mitigate potential compatibility issues, explicitly switch the `JAVA_HOME` environment to the installed JDK 11 (`/opt/jdk11`) for the duration of this command. Also, add `sdkmanager --update` before installing the packages to ensure the tool itself is current. This isolates the Android SDK setup with a known-compatible Java version and can resolve common tooling failures.

If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.544 
  #12 1.544 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
  #12 1.544 
  #12 1.544 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

  #12 1.544 5. Your Developer Credentials
  #12 1.544

  #12 1.544 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #12 1.544 
  #12 1.544 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.
  #12 1.544 
  #12 1.544 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

  #12 1.544 
  #12 1.544 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10. GENERAL.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.548 
  #12 1.548 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

--- End of Iteration 8 ---

=== Iteration 9 - [2025-08-28 14:34:01] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been updated to install multiple required JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools. The previous build failed with an `UnsupportedClassVersionError` because the `sdkmanager` tool was executed with an incompatible Java version (Java 11 or older), while the tool itself requires Java 17. The current Dockerfile attempts to fix this by setting the default `JAVA_HOME` to JDK 17, but it incorrectly switches back to JDK 11 for the `sdkmanager --update` and package installation commands, which will cause the same error to reoccur.
  next step
  Modify the `RUN` command for the Android SDK setup to ensure all `sdkmanager` invocations use the compatible JDK 17. Remove the `JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_11_HOME}` prefix from the `sdkmanager --update` and `sdkmanager --verbose` commands, allowing them to use the default `JAVA_HOME` which is already correctly set to JDK 17.

  #12 1.518 10. GENERAL.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.518 
  #12 1.518 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

--- End of Iteration 9 ---

=== Iteration 10 - [2025-08-28 14:35:26] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully installs base dependencies, multiple JDK versions, Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools. The build process fails during the `sdkmanager` step, which is responsible for downloading and installing the required Android platform and build tools. The log indicates the failure occurs while unzipping SDK components, suggesting a potential resource issue or instability caused by the `sdkmanager --update` command.
  next step
  Modify the `sdkmanager` installation `RUN` command in the Dockerfile. Remove the potentially unstable `sdkmanager --update` step and combine the license acceptance and package installation into a single, more direct command: `yes | sdkmanager --licenses && sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`. This change improves the command's reliability in an automated build environment.

  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 4.7 The SDK is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process.

  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 7.2 You should be aware that the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

  #12 1.558 
  #12 1.558 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService, as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the following URL: https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/, as updated from time to time.

  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.3 You agree that if you use the Preview to develop applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely.

  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.

  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release.

  #12 1.563 
  #12 1.563 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf).

  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.566 
  #12 1.566 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation.

--- End of Iteration 10 ---

=== Iteration 11 - [2025-08-28 14:36:42] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  A comprehensive Dockerfile has been created to install all specified prerequisites, including multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools. Environment variables such as `JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`, and `PATH` are configured correctly according to the plan. The previous build attempt failed during the `sdkmanager` step while unzipping Android SDK components, suggesting the build process exhausted available resources like disk space or memory.
  next step
  Modify the `RUN` instruction that executes `sdkmanager` to include a cleanup command within the same layer. This will immediately remove temporary files and caches created by `sdkmanager` after the required components are installed, reducing the layer's disk footprint and mitigating the resource exhaustion issue that caused the previous build to fail.

  #12 1.577 To get started with the Android SDK Preview, you must agree to the following terms and conditions. As described below, please note that this is a preview version of the Android SDK, subject to change, that you use at your own risk. The Android SDK Preview is not a stable release, and may contain errors and defects that can result in serious damage to your computer systems, devices and data.
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 This is the Android SDK Preview License Agreement (the "License Agreement").
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 1. Introduction
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 1.1 The Android SDK Preview (referred to in the License Agreement as the “Preview” and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Preview library files, if and when they are made available) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the Preview.
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL: http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 2.3 You may not use the Preview and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the Preview under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Preview.
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 2.4 If you will use the Preview internally within your company or organization you agree to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, and you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the Preview on behalf of your employer or other entity.

  #12 1.577 3. Preview License from Google
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited, revocable license to use the Preview, personally or internally within your company or organization, solely to develop applications to run on the Android platform.
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 3.2 You agree that Google or third parties owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Preview, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the Preview. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 3.3 You may not use the Preview for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not: (a) copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Preview or any part of the Preview; or (b) load any part of the Preview onto a mobile handset or any other hardware device except a personal computer, combine any part of the Preview with other software, or distribute any software or device incorporating a part of the Preview.

  #12 1.577 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the Preview that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the Preview may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the Preview.

  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 4.2 You agree to use the Preview and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 4.3 You agree that if you use the Preview to develop applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If users provide you with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.

  #12 1.577 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

  #12 1.577 
  #12 1.577 4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release.

With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.580 
  #12 1.580 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

--- End of Iteration 11 ---

=== Iteration 12 - [2025-08-28 14:37:55] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup according to the project plan, including installations for multiple JDKs, Go, and the Android SDK. The attempt to build the Docker image failed during the installation of Android SDK components, indicated by an error log showing an incomplete unzipping process, which suggests a potential resource issue (e.g., disk space) during the build.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile by consolidating the multiple `RUN` commands for tool installations (JDKs, Go, Android SDK) into a single, chained `RUN` command. This will reduce the number of intermediate layers and ensure temporary files like downloaded archives are created and deleted within the same layer, minimizing the disk space required during the build process and addressing the likely cause of the failure.

If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.533 
  #12 1.533 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

  #12 1.533 
  #12 1.533 4.7 The SDK is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the SDK, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the SDK having the full functionality of a stable release.

  #12 1.533 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.

  #12 1.537 This is the Android SDK Preview License Agreement (the "License Agreement").
  #12 1.537

  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 1.1 The Android SDK Preview (referred to in the License Agreement as the “Preview” and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Preview library files, if and when they are made available) is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the Preview.
  #12 1.537

  #12 1.537 2.3 You may not use the Preview and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the Preview under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Preview.
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 2.4 If you will use the Preview internally within your company or organization you agree to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, and you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the License Agreement.

  #12 1.537 3. Preview License from Google
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited, revocable license to use the Preview, personally or internally within your company or organization, solely to develop applications to run on the Android platform.
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 3.2 You agree that Google or third parties owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Preview, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the Preview. "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 3.3 You may not use the Preview for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not: (a) copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Preview or any part of the Preview; or (b) load any part of the Preview onto a mobile handset or any other hardware device except a personal computer, combine any part of the Preview with other software, or distribute any software or device incorporating a part of the Preview.

  #12 1.537 3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the Preview that Google provides may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the Preview may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the Preview.

  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 4.2 You agree to use the Preview and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 4.3 You agree that if you use the Preview to develop applications, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If users provide you with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, each user has given you permission to do so.
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the Preview, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of Google or any third party.

  #12 1.537 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.
  #12 1.537 
  #12 1.537 4.7 The Preview is in development, and your testing and feedback are an important part of the development process. By using the Preview, you acknowledge that implementation of some features are still under development and that you should not rely on the Preview having the full functionality of a stable release.

Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #12 1.541 
  #12 1.541 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #12 1.541 
  #12 1.541 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #12 1.541 
  #12 1.541 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #12 1.541 
  #12 1.541 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #12 1.541 
  #12 1.541 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #12 1.541 
  #12 1.541 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.

--- End of Iteration 12 ---

=== Iteration 13 - [2025-08-28 14:40:41] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup based on the detailed plan. The Docker image build process was initiated but failed. The failure occurred within a large, monolithic `RUN` command responsible for downloading and installing all required tools (JDKs, Go, Android SDK, GraalVM). The provided log does not specify the exact command that caused the failure within this large block.
  next step
  Refactor the single, large `RUN` command in the Dockerfile into multiple, separate `RUN` commands. Each new `RUN` command should be responsible for a single logical step, such as installing base dependencies, installing JDK 8, installing JDK 11, and so on. This change will isolate the point of failure, make the Dockerfile more readable, and leverage Docker's layer caching to speed up debugging and subsequent builds.

--- End of Iteration 13 ---

=== Iteration 14 - [2025-08-28 14:42:58] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile setup for installing multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and the Android SDK is complete and functional. However, the Docker image build fails during the GraalVM installation step. The log shows the `wget` command exited with code 8, indicating a server error, which is likely caused by an inability to follow the download URL's HTTP redirects.
  next step
  In the Dockerfile, modify the `RUN` command responsible for installing GraalVM. Update the `wget` command to include the `-L` flag to ensure it correctly follows redirects from the GitHub release URL. The updated command should be `wget -q -L --no-check-certificate ...`.

--- End of Iteration 14 ---

=== Iteration 15 - [2025-08-28 14:43:54] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.
NEXT:
  current progress
  A Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup based on the provided plan. The file successfully installs base dependencies, multiple JDKs (8, 11, 17), Go, and the Android SDK command-line tools. The Docker image build fails during the GraalVM installation step. The log indicates an `exit code: 8` from `wget`, which signifies a server error, likely a 404 Not Found, because the specified GraalVM version `22.3.5` is invalid and does not exist in the release repository.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to use a valid GraalVM version. Change the `ARG GRAALVM_VERSION` from `22.3.5` to an existing version, such as `22.3.3`. This will correct the download URL, resolve the `wget` failure, and allow the Docker image build to proceed with the GraalVM installation.

--- End of Iteration 15 ---

=== Iteration 16 - [2025-08-28 14:47:07] ===
PLAN:
  Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan. The modifications primarily focus on adapting GUI-dependent steps to a command-line-only Linux container environment and clarifying the execution of Android instrumented tests.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **JDK (Java Development Kit):** Version 8, 11, 17, or 21. The project is tested against these LTS versions. Recommended distributions include Adoptium Temurin or Zulu OpenJDK. `JAVA_HOME` must be set correctly. **Note:** The Android build uses Gradle (compatible with JDK 8-18) but the module's source code is configured for **Java 8 compatibility**. For the Android module build environment, it is recommended to use **JDK 11 or 17**. The `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules require **Java 8**. The `example-spring6-test`, `fastjson2-extension-spring6`, `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`, and `test-jdk17` modules require **JDK 17+**. Building the `fastjson2-codegen` module on JDK 8 requires a full JDK installation (not a JRE) as it depends on `tools.jar`.
      *   **Go (Golang):** Version **1.18+** is required for building and running the native Go-based performance benchmarks (e.g., against the Sonic library) located in the `benchmark` module.
      *   **Android SDK:** Required for building the Android module. **As this is a non-GUI Linux environment, the SDK must be installed using the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.** The `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variable must be set.
          *   **Required SDK Platform:** **Android API 31 (`compileSdk 31`)**, **Build-Tools**, and **Platform-Tools** must be installed via the `sdkmanager` command-line tool.
          *   The project targets **Android API 29 (`targetSdk 29`)** and has a minimum requirement of **Android API 26 (`minSdk 26`)**.
      *   **Build Tools:**
          *   **Maven Wrapper:** The core project uses the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`/`mvnw.cmd`), so a global installation of Apache Maven is **optional**. The wrapper should be configured to automatically download and use a recent Maven version (e.g., **Apache Maven 3.9.x**).
          *   **Gradle Wrapper:** The Android project uses the Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`), so a global installation of Gradle is **optional**. The wrapper is configured to automatically download and use **Gradle 7.5**.
          *   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness):** (Managed by Maven) Required for running performance benchmarks in the `benchmark` module. The necessary dependencies (`jmh-core`, `jmh-generator-annprocess`) are included in the build file.
          *   **Maven Checkstyle Plugin:** (Managed by Maven) Used to enforce code style and quality standards during the build process, based on a project-specific configuration file.
      *   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** **Note: The specified `linux/amd64` container environment is intended for command-line builds and testing (CI/CD). IDEs are GUI-based and should be run on a developer's host machine, not within the container.**
          *   **Recommended for Host Machine:** **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate/Community Edition** (with the Android plugin).
          *   Alternatives for Host Machine: Eclipse (with Android Developer Tools), or Visual Studio Code with appropriate extensions.
          *   The project includes an `.editorconfig` file. Ensure the IDE on your host machine has the EditorConfig plugin enabled to maintain consistent code style.
          *   It is highly recommended to install a **Checkstyle plugin** in your host IDE (e.g., "Checkstyle-IDEA" for IntelliJ) for real-time feedback on code style.
          *   For working on the `benchmark`, `example-spring-test`, `example-spring6-test`, and `example-solon-test` modules, an IDE plugin for **Lombok** is recommended on the host machine.
      *   **Git:** Required for version control and to utilize the `.gitignore` configuration.
      *   **Required Command-Line Utilities:**
          *   These must be installed using the container's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install -y curl wget unzip` on Debian/Ubuntu).
          *   For Unix-like systems (`mvnw`, `gradlew`): `curl` or `wget` and `unzip` or `tar` should be available in the system's `PATH`.
          *   For Windows (`mvnw.cmd`, `gradlew.bat`): **PowerShell** is required for the Maven wrapper script.
      *   **Kotlin:** A recent version is required. The `kotlin-maven-plugin` is used for the `fastjson2-kotlin` module. Key dependencies like `kotlin-stdlib-jdk8` and `kotlin-reflect` are managed by the build tools.
      *   **GraalVM:** (Optional, Advanced) Required for building native images. The `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` module specifically requires it. A version compatible with `native-maven-plugin:0.10.6` is needed. This is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` environment.
      *   **Maven Daemon (mvnd):** (Optional, Advanced) For faster Maven builds.
      *   **Dokka:** (Optional, Advanced) The `dokka-maven-plugin` is used in a release profile to generate documentation for the Kotlin module.
      *   **Project Modules (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **`fastjson2`:** The core library.
          *   **`fastjson2-kotlin`:** A dedicated module for enhanced serialization/deserialization of Kotlin classes, data classes, and other Kotlin-specific features.
          *   **`fastjson` (v1 compatibility):** A module named `fastjson1-compatible` with artifactId `fastjson` provides a compatibility layer for projects migrating from `fastjson v1.x`.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension`:** Provides optional support for various third-party libraries (e.g., Retrofit, Redisson, Apache Arrow).
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring5`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 5.x and Spring Boot 2.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-spring6`:** Provides integration support for Spring Framework 6.x and Spring Boot 3.x.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-solon`:** Provides integration support for the Solon framework.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs`:** Parent module for JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services) support.
          *   **`fastjson2-extension-jaxrs-javax`:** Provides JAX-RS integration for the `javax.ws.rs` namespace.
          *   **`fastjson2-codegen`:** For compile-time code generation, used to improve performance and support environments like GraalVM Native Image.
          *   **`fastjson2-benchmark`:** A module containing JMH performance benchmarks to compare `fastjson2` against other libraries.
          *   **`fastjson2-example-graalvm-native`:** An example module demonstrating native image compilation with GraalVM.
          *   **`example-spring-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 2.x and Spring Framework 5.x.
          *   **`example-spring6-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Framework 6.x, Spring Data, and MyBatis-Plus.
          *   **`example-solon-test`:** An example module demonstrating integration with the Solon framework.
          *   **`safemode-test`:** A module for testing the library's "safe mode" functionality.
          *   **`test-jdk17`:** A module for testing compatibility with Java 17+ language features (e.g., Records, Sealed Classes).
      *   **Third-Party Libraries for Integration/Testing/Benchmarking (Managed by build tools):**
          *   **JSON/Serialization Libraries:** Jackson (`jackson-databind`), Gson (`gson`), **Kryo**, **Apache Fury**, **DSL-JSON**, `json-lib`, `json-path`, `json-simple`, `jsoniter`, `wast`.
          *   **Native JSON Libraries (for benchmarking):** **Go/Sonic** (`github.com/bytedance/sonic`).
          *   **Frameworks:** Dubbo, **Spring Framework (v5, v6)**, **Spring Boot (v2, v3)**, **Spring Data (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB)**, **Spring Security (v6)**, **MyBatis Plus**, **Solon** (including `solon-parent` BOM, `solon-boot-jdkhttp`, `solon-logging-simple`, and `solon-test`), Springfox, **Retrofit**, **Flink**, **Hibernate**, **JAX-RS** (including `javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api`, `jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api`, and implementations like **Jersey**).
          *   **Data Formats & Protocols:** Protocol Buffers, Apache Arrow, Hessian, BSON (`org.mongodb:bson`), MessagePack, **OpenCSV**, **Univocity Parsers**, **JavaCSV**.
          *   **Schema Validation:** **Everit JSON Schema**, **NetworkNT JSON Schema Validator**.
          *   **Common Libraries:** Guava, Joda-Time, Apache Commons Lang/IO, Java Money API (`moneta`), Jakarta Bean Validation, Reactor Core, **Airlift Slice**, **CGLIB**, **Lombok**, **Hutool**, **Log4j2**.
          *   **Database Drivers:** Oracle (`ojdbc8`), Dameng (`DmJdbcDriver18`), **H2 Database** (`com.h2database:h2`), **ClickHouse JDBC**.
          *   **Cloud/Service SDKs:** Aliyun ODPS & DingTalk SDKs.
          *   **In-Memory Data Grids:** **Redisson**.
          *   **Embedded Servers:** **Jetty**.
          *   **Other JVM Languages:** **Clojure**, **Groovy**.
      *   **Recommended System Resources:**
          *   At least 4GB of RAM is recommended for smooth Gradle builds, as the build is configured to use up to 2GB of heap space. This is especially important when allocating resources to the Docker container.
  2.  FILES TO CREATE:
      *   **(This section is unchanged as it describes the project's file structure, which is independent of the execution environment.)**
      *   **`.gitignore`:** Defines which files and directories should be ignored by Git.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.gitignore`)
          *   **Content Description:** Should contain standard ignore patterns for Java, Maven (`target/`), **Gradle** (`.gradle/`, `build/`), various IDEs (IntelliJ, Android Studio, Eclipse, VSCode), OS-specific files, and **Android artifacts** (`*.apk`, `local.properties`).
      *   **`.editorconfig`:** Defines and maintains consistent code style settings across various editors and IDEs.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/.editorconfig`)
          *   **Content Description:** Configures all files to use `utf-8` charset, `lf` line endings, and a final newline. It sets a default of 4-space indentation, trimming trailing whitespace. Specific overrides include 2-space indentation for `yaml`, `sh`, and `ps1` files, and disables trailing whitespace trimming for Markdown files. It also includes IntelliJ-specific settings for JavaDoc alignment and continuation indentation for Java and Android XML files.
      *   **Checkstyle Configuration (`fastjson2-checks.xml`):** Defines the code style and quality rules enforced by Checkstyle.
          *   **Path:** `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml`
          *   **Content Description:** An XML file containing a comprehensive set of Checkstyle rules. It enforces policies such as using LF line endings, no tabs, no trailing whitespace, specific import ordering, required braces for control statements, whitespace conventions around operators, naming conventions, and other code quality checks. This file is used by the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` to validate the codebase during the build.
      *   **Parent Project Build File (`pom.xml`):** The parent POM for the multi-module Maven project.
          *   **Path:** Project root directory (`/pom.xml`)
          *   **Content Description:** Defines group ID, version, shared properties (like `fastjson1x.version`, `springboot3.version`, `solon.version`), and dependency management for all submodules. It must declare the project modules, including `<module>core</module>`, `<module>kotlin</module>`, `<module>extension</module>`, `<module>extension-spring5</module>`, `<module>extension-spring6</module>`, `<module>extension-solon</module>`, `<module>extension-jaxrs</module>`, `<module>fastjson1-compatible</module>`, `<module>codegen</module>`, `<module>benchmark</module>`, `<module>fastjson2-example-graalvm-native</module>`, `<module>example-spring-test</module>`, `<module>example-spring6-test</module>`, `<module>example-solon-test</module>`, `<module>safemode-test</module>`, and `<module>test-jdk17</module>`. It must also configure the `maven-checkstyle-plugin` in the `<build>` section, pointing it to the `src/checkstyle/fastjson2-checks.xml` configuration file and binding it to the `validate` lifecycle phase to ensure code style is checked early in the build process.
      *   **... (All other file descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
      *   **Android Resource Files:** Required resources for the Android application.
          *   **Path:** `android-test/app/src/main/res/`
          *   **Content Description:** Includes `values/strings.xml`, `values/themes.xml`, and `mipmap` directories for launcher icons.
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   **(This section is mostly unchanged, with crucial clarifications for Android instrumented testing in a container.)**
      *   **Code Quality and Style Conformance:**
          *   **Static Analysis:** The build process must include a static analysis step using Checkstyle. A build should fail if the code violates the rules defined in `fastjson2-checks.xml`, such as incorrect formatting, unused imports, or other quality issues.
      *   **Core JVM Module Tests (`core` module):**
          *   **Object to JSON Serialization:** Serialize a `User` instance to a JSON string and byte array.
          *   **JSON to Object Deserialization:** Parse a JSON string into a `User` instance.
          *   **Generic JSON Parsing:** Parse JSON into `JSONObject` and `JSONArray`.
          *   **JSONB Format Usage:** Serialize to and deserialize from the binary `JSONB` format.
          *   **JSONPath Usage:** Extract values using `JSONPath` expressions.
          *   **Java Platform Module System (JPMS):** Verify compatibility with the Java 9+ module system by consuming the library as a JPMS module. This includes checking that all exported packages are accessible, that reflective operations enabled by the `open module` directive work as expected, and that features relying on `jdk.unsupported` (e.g., `Unsafe`) function correctly when run on a modular classpath.
      *   **... (All other test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged until the Android section) ...**
      *   **Android Module Tests (`android-test/app`):**
          *   **Android Runtime Compatibility:** Verify core serialization/deserialization functions work on the Android Runtime.
          *   **Kotlin Data Class Serialization:** Verify seamless serialization and deserialization of Kotlin data classes using the `fastjson2-kotlin` module.
          *   **Android Unit Tests:** (Run on local JVM) Test library logic without needing a device. These are fully supported in the container environment.
          *   **Android Instrumented Tests:** (Run on an Android emulator or device) Test library behavior in a true Android environment. **Note: Running these tests within a standard Docker container is non-trivial as it requires a connected device or a specially configured emulator (e.g., using a privileged container with KVM access). The primary focus in this environment should be on successfully building the app and running unit tests.**
          *   **Benchmark/Compatibility Tests:** Compare serialization/deserialization performance against Jackson and Gson on the Android runtime.
          *   **ProGuard/R8 Shrinking and Obfuscation Test:** Build a release version of the Android app with code shrinking and obfuscation enabled (`minifyEnabled true`). The build process itself validates that the ProGuard rules are syntactically correct. **To fully confirm runtime correctness, the generated release APK must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or an emulator running outside of this basic container setup.**
      *   **... (All subsequent test case descriptions from the original plan remain unchanged) ...**
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      *   **Step 1: Install Prerequisites**
          *   Download and install a JDK (version 8, 11, 17, or 21). Set `JAVA_HOME`. For building the Android module, **JDK 11 or 17 is recommended**. For the `example-spring-test` and `example-solon-test` modules, **JDK 8 is required**. For the Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 extension, GraalVM example, and `test-jdk17` modules, **JDK 17+ is required**.
          *   Download and install **Go (Golang) version 1.18 or newer**. This is required for the native performance benchmarks.
          *   **Download and install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools.**
          *   Unzip the tools to a location of your choice (e.g., `/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Set the `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) environment variable to this location (e.g., `export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk`).
          *   Add the command-line tools to your path: `export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"`.
          *   Using the command-line `sdkmanager`, accept licenses and install the required packages:
              *   `yes | sdkmanager --licenses`
              *   `sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-31" "build-tools;31.0.0"`
          *   Download and install Git.
          *   **Note on IDEs:** Remember that IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ) and their plugins (EditorConfig, Checkstyle, Lombok) are to be installed on your **host development machine**, not inside the Linux build container.
          *   (Optional) Download and install GraalVM and set it as `JAVA_HOME` if you intend to build the native image example.
          *   **Verification:** Run `java -version`, `go version`, `git --version`, and `adb version`.
      *   **Step 2: Create a Multi-Module Project Structure and Initialize Git**
          *   Create a root project directory. Inside, create a `core` directory, a `kotlin` directory, an `extension` directory, an `extension-spring5` directory, an `extension-spring6` directory, an `extension-solon` directory, an `extension-jaxrs` directory (and its submodule directory `extension-jaxrs/extension-jaxrs-javax`), a `fastjson1-compatible` directory, a `codegen` directory, a `benchmark` directory, an `android-test` directory, a `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native` directory, an `example-spring-test` directory, an `example-spring6-test` directory, an `example-solon-test` directory, a `safemode-test` directory, a `test-jdk17` directory, and a `src/checkstyle` directory.
          *   Navigate into the root directory and initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
      *   **Step 3: Add and Configure the Maven and Gradle Wrappers**
          *   **Maven:** In the project root, create a minimal parent `pom.xml` and run `mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper` to add `mvnw`.
          *   **Gradle:** Navigate into the `android-test` directory. Create a minimal `settings.gradle` and run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5` to generate the `gradlew` files.
          *   On Unix-like systems, ensure both wrappers are executable: `chmod +x mvnw` and `chmod +x android-test/gradlew`.
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw --version` from the root and `./gradlew --version` from the `android-test` directory.
      *   **Step 4: Create Project Configuration Files (`.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`)**
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.gitignore`. Add standard Java/Maven (`target/`), IDE patterns, and also add **Gradle (`.gradle/`, `build/`) and Android (`*.apk`, `local.properties`)** ignore patterns.
          *   In the project root, create a file named `.editorconfig` with the content specified in Section 2.
          *   **Verification:** Run `git status`. Ignored directories like `core/target/` and `android-test/build/` should not appear.
      *   **Step 5: Configure Project Dependencies and Modules**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating build scripts, which are environment-agnostic.)**
          *   **Verification:** Run `./mvnw clean install` from the root. Then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. Both should succeed. The Maven build will fail if there are any code style violations.
      *   **Step 6: Create Source Code and Test Files**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves creating source code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 7: Implement Functionality and Tests**
          *   **(This step is unchanged as it involves writing code, which is environment-agnostic.)**
      *   **Step 8 (Optional): Add CI Workflow**
          *   Create `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`.
          *   Configure the workflow to install Java, **Go**, set up the Android SDK (using command-line tools), run `./mvnw clean install`, and then run `cd android-test && ./gradlew build`. **Note that running `connectedCheck` in CI requires a more complex setup with an active emulator or device.**
      *   **Step 9: Build and Run the Application and Tests**
          *   **Core Module (Maven):**
              *   Compile & Test: `./mvnw install` (This will first validate code style with Checkstyle, then compile and run tests for all applicable Maven modules).
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl core exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.app.App"`
          *   **Spring Boot 2 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring-test spring-boot:run`
          *   **Spring Boot 3 Module (Maven):**
              *   Run App: `./mvnw -pl example-spring6-test spring-boot:run`
              *   Access H2 Console: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
          *   **Solon Module (Maven):**
              *   Build App: `./mvnw -pl example-solon-test package`
              *   Run App: `java -jar example-solon-test/target/example-solon-test.jar`
          *   **Benchmark Module (Maven):**
              *   Build Go Executable: `cd benchmark/src/test/java/com/alibaba/fastjson2/benchmark/sonic/ && go build && cd ../../../../../../../..`
              *   Build Uberjar: `./mvnw -pl benchmark package`
              *   Run Benchmarks: `java -jar benchmark/target/fastjson2-benchmarks.jar` (add JMH options as needed, e.g., `-f 1 -wi 1 -i 1` for a quick test run).
          *   **Android Module (Gradle):**
              *   (Navigate to `android-test` directory)
              *   Build: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
              *   Run Unit Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest`
              *   Run Instrumented Tests (requires connected device/emulator): `./gradlew :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest`
                  *   **Environment Note:** This command will fail in the standard container setup unless an Android device is connected (e.g., via `adb connect`) or an emulator is running in a specially configured environment.
              *   Build Release APK (with shrinking): `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`
              *   **Verification Note:** After building the release APK, it must be manually installed and tested on a physical device or a properly configured emulator to verify that the ProGuard/R8 rules are working correctly at runtime.
          *   **Verification:** All builds and unit tests should pass. The Spring Boot applications, Solon application, Android app, and benchmarks should be launchable.
      *   **Step 10 (Optional, Advanced): Build and Run as GraalVM Native Image**
          *   This step is fully compatible with the `linux/amd64` command-line environment.
          *   Ensure GraalVM is your active `JAVA_HOME`.
          *   Build the native image: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative package`.
          *   Run native tests: `./mvnw -pl fastjson2-example-graalvm-native -Pnative test`.
          *   Run the executable from the `fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target` directory (e.g., `./fastjson2-example-graalvm-native/target/my-app`).
          *   **Verification:** The native executable should run and produce the same output as the JVM version. The native tests should pass.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully creates a complete and correct build environment according to the plan. It installs all specified versions of the JDK (8, 11, 17), Go, the Android SDK Command-Line Tools, and GraalVM. All required environment variables (`JAVA_HOME`, `ANDROID_HOME`, `PATH`) are properly configured. The project source code is copied into the container, and the Maven and Gradle wrappers are made executable. The environment setup phase is complete.
  next step
  Add a multi-stage `RUN` instruction to the Dockerfile to execute the project's build and test commands, thereby validating the environment and the project code. This step should execute the main Maven build (`./mvnw clean install`) and the Android Gradle build (`cd android-test && ./gradlew build`). Given the multiple JDK requirements, this command should switch the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable as needed for different build profiles or modules.

  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10. GENERAL.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient’s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS’ express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #13 1.590 
  #13 1.590 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.
