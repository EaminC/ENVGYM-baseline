current progress
The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the initial environment setup (Steps 1-4 of the plan). It correctly configures a Python 3.7 base, installs Git, clones the repository, and installs the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`. It also includes a `RUN` command that successfully verifies the CPU-only PyTorch installation. The basic environment is ready.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to execute the validation test cases outlined in the plan (Steps 5-8). This involves adding `RUN` commands to perform a short training run, generate plots, and verify that the scripts execute without errors and create the expected output files and directories (`saves/`, `plots/`, `runs/`), thus confirming the end-to-end functionality of the cloned application within the container.
