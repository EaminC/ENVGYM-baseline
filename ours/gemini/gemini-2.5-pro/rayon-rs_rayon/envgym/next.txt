current progress
The Dockerfile successfully automates the complete environment setup as defined in Step 1 of the plan. It installs all required system dependencies (build-essential, graphics libraries, git), Rust toolchains (stable, beta, nightly), components (rustfmt), cross-compilation targets (i686, wasm), and the wasmtime runtime. It also correctly configures the necessary environment variables (PATH, RUST_MIN_STACK, WASI runner), resulting in an interactive container ready for manual execution of build and test commands.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to automate the build and test process outlined in Steps 2 and 3 of the plan. Add a `RUN` command to execute the core test suite (e.g., `cargo test --workspace`). This command should incorporate the BuildKit cache mount optimizations (`--mount=type=cache`) and the parallel build jobs variable (`export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=$(nproc)`) as recommended in the plan's example Dockerfile to validate the environment and speed up builds.
