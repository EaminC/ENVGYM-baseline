current progress
The Dockerfile successfully automates the entire environment setup as defined in the plan's TODO list, from step 1 through 8. It installs all system prerequisites, Kubernetes tools, and the Rust toolchain. It then proceeds to clone and build the specified version of the Verus formal verification tool from source. Finally, it creates the complete project directory structure and populates it with all necessary configuration files, build scripts, and placeholder source files. The resulting image is a self-contained development environment where a user can begin executing the verification and testing tasks (steps 9-14).

next step
Refactor the Dockerfile into a multi-stage build to significantly improve build performance and maintainability. The current single-stage structure forces a complete, time-consuming rebuild of the Verus toolchain for any minor change to the project files. A multi-stage approach should be adopted: Stage 1 for installing system dependencies, Stage 2 for the lengthy Verus compilation, and a final stage for creating the project files. This will leverage Docker's layer caching, allowing for rapid iteration on project scripts without re-executing the slow dependency installation and compilation steps.
