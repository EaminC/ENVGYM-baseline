current progress
The Dockerfile has successfully configured the base environment. It starts from a Miniconda image, installs system-level dependencies (git, curl), creates a non-root user, and uses SDKMAN! to install the specified Java (8.0.302-open) and Maven (3.8.6) versions. The project source code is also correctly copied into the image at `/home/itdocker/exli`.

next step
Uncomment and enable the remaining `RUN` commands in the Dockerfile to complete the image setup. These commands will:
1.  Build the `raninline` and `jacoco-extension` Java components using Maven.
2.  Install the custom Jacoco Maven extension into the correct `lib/ext` directory.
3.  Execute the provided scripts to create the `exli` Conda environment and install all required Python packages.
4.  Configure the user's `.bashrc` to automatically activate the `exli` Conda environment on login.
