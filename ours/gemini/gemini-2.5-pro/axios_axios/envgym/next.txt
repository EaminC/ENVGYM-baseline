current progress
The Dockerfile successfully prepares the complete development environment. It installs all system prerequisites (Node.js, Git, Chromium), clones the project repository, navigates into the project directory, and installs all project dependencies using `npm ci`. This completes steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 of the setup plan. The resulting Docker image contains the project with its `node_modules` installed, ready for testing or development.

next step
Add a validation layer to the Dockerfile by executing the project's full test suite. Insert the command `RUN npm test` after the `npm ci` step. This will run all linting, type-checking, and unit/browser tests as defined in Step 7 of the plan, ensuring the environment is correctly configured and the project is fully functional within the container.
