current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the environment setup, dependency installation, and project build stages from the plan (Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). It correctly configures the base image with Node.js 22.14.0, installs system dependencies like Git and Chromium, enables corepack, installs project dependencies via `pnpm install`, and compiles the project using `pnpm build --withTypes`.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to add the verification and testing stages outlined in the plan. Insert `RUN` commands after the build step to execute the code quality checks (Step 5: `pnpm format-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm type-check`) and run all test suites (Step 7: `pnpm test-unit`, `pnpm test-e2e`, `pnpm test-dts`) to fully validate the environment and the built project.
