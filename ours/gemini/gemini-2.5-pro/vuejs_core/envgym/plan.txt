Based on the provided hardware and environment information, here is the adjusted and validated environment setup plan.

=== ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (ADJUSTED) ===

1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
    -   **Node.js**: The environment must provide Node.js version **`22.14.0`**, as specified in the `.node-version` file. In a containerized setup (e.g., Docker), this is best achieved by using a `linux/amd64` base image like `node:22.14.0`.
    -   **pnpm**: Version `9.x` is required. This will be managed by `corepack`, which is bundled with the specified Node.js version and should be enabled.
    -   **npm**: A recent version of `npm` should be available for compatibility with release workflows. It can be updated via `npm i -g npm@latest` after Node.js is set up.
    -   **Git**: Required for version control operations, release tagging, and running hooks. It must be installed in the environment.
    -   **Chromium Headless Browser**: Required for running end-to-end (E2E) tests with Puppeteer. Since the environment is a headless `linux/amd64` system without a GPU, a command-line installable version of Chromium and its dependencies is necessary. For Debian/Ubuntu-based images, this can be installed via `apt-get install -y chromium`.
    -   **Build-essential Tools (if needed)**: Depending on the base Linux image, tools like `python`, `make`, and `g++` might be required for compiling native Node.js addons used by dependencies. These are typically included in packages like `build-essential`.
    -   **Netlify CLI (Optional)**: For testing deployment builds. It can be installed globally via `pnpm add -g netlify-cli`.
    -   **Note on Code Editors**: Tools like Visual Studio Code and its extensions (**Prettier**, **ESLint**, **Vitest**, etc.) are for the *local developer's machine*, not the target `linux/amd64` environment. The configuration files (`.vscode/`, `.prettierrc`, `eslint.config.js`) will be used by command-line tools (like `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format-check`) within the target environment to enforce code quality.

2.  FILES TO CREATE:
    -   **`pnpm-lock.yaml`**: This file must be present in the project root (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`) to ensure deterministic dependency installation.
    -   **`node_modules/` directory**: Will be created at `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core/node_modules` after running `pnpm install`.
    -   **`dist/` directories**: Will be created inside each package (e.g., `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core/packages/runtime-dom/dist`) after a successful build. They contain compiled JavaScript in various formats and TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`, `.d.mts`).
    -   **Sub-module directories**: Build outputs for specific sub-modules (e.g., `compiler-sfc/`, `server-renderer/`) will be populated within their respective package directories.
    -   **`temp/` directory**: Will be created at `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core/temp` during TypeScript compilation.
    -   **`dts-build/` directory**: An intermediate directory that may be created at the project root during the declaration file generation process.
    -   **`.eslintcache`**: A cache file generated by ESLint at the project root to speed up subsequent linting.
    -   **`*.tsbuildinfo` files**: TypeScript compiler cache files generated to accelerate incremental builds.
    -   **`coverage/` directory**: Will be generated at the project root after running tests with coverage enabled.
    -   **`*.log` files**: May be generated by various processes.
    -   **`*.tgz` files**: Packaged tarballs created by `pnpm pack`, used for local testing.
    -   **Note**: All necessary configuration files (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.node-version`, `tsconfig.json`, `rollup.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`, `netlify.toml`, etc.) are expected to be present in the source code at `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`.

3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
    -   **Unit Tests (`test-unit`)**: Tests for individual functions and modules, covering reactivity, component lifecycle, SSR, DOM manipulation, SFC compilation (including Pug and Sass), and JSX/TSX support.
    -   **End-to-End Tests (`test-e2e`)**: Browser-based tests simulating user interactions. These tests depend on the headless Chromium browser being correctly installed and configured in the `linux/amd64` environment.
    -   **Test Code Quality**: All tests must pass linting checks, with no disabled (`.skip`) or focused (`.only`) tests committed.
    -   **TypeScript Definition Tests (`test-dts`)**: Compile-time tests to validate the correctness of generated `.d.ts` and `.d.mts` declaration files for both CommonJS and ESM consumers.
    -   **Benchmark Tests (`bench`)**: Performance tests for critical code paths, executed via `vitest bench`.
    -   **Build Output Verification**: Tests ensuring all build formats (`esm-bundler`, `cjs`, `global`, etc.) and package entry points (`.`, `vue/server-renderer`, etc.) are functional as defined in `package.json` `exports`.
    -   **Release Process Verification**: Dry runs (`pnpm publish --dry-run`) and local packing (`pnpm pack`) to validate package contents before publishing.
    -   **Deployment Build Verification**: Verification that the deployment build command runs successfully and produces the expected static assets, consistent with the `netlify.toml` configuration.

4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
    -   **Step 1: Prepare the Base Environment**
        -   **Action**: Ensure the `linux/amd64` environment has the necessary system-level dependencies installed.
          ```bash
          # For Debian/Ubuntu-based images. Adjust for other distributions (e.g., apk add for Alpine).
          apt-get update
          apt-get install -y git chromium build-essential
          ```
        -   **Verification**: Run `git --version` and `chromium --version`. The commands should execute successfully.

    -   **Step 2: Set up Node.js and Enable Corepack**
        -   **Action**: The environment should be configured to use Node.js `22.14.0`. In a Docker context, this is handled by the `FROM node:22.14.0` instruction. Then, enable Corepack and update npm.
          ```bash
          # Enable corepack to manage pnpm
          corepack enable
          
          # Recommended: update npm to the latest version
          npm i -g npm@latest
          ```
        -   **Verification**: Run `node --version` and confirm the output is `v22.14.0`. Run `pnpm --version` and `npm --version` to confirm they are installed and accessible.

    -   **Step 3: Prepare Project Source Code**
        -   **Action**: Place the project source code into the specified working directory. In a Docker context, this is typically done with a `COPY` instruction.
          ```dockerfile
          # Example Dockerfile instruction
          WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core
          COPY . .
          ```
        -   **Verification**: The command `ls -la /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core` should list the project files, including `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and `.node-version`.

    -   **Step 4: Install Project Dependencies**
        -   **Action**: From the project root (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core`), run `pnpm install`. This will install all monorepo dependencies according to `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
          ```bash
          cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core
          pnpm install
          ```
        -   **Verification**: The command should complete without errors. The directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core/node_modules` should now exist.

    -   **Step 5: Verify Code Quality and Type Safety**
        -   **Action**: Run the command-line scripts to check formatting, linting, and TypeScript types.
          ```bash
          pnpm format-check
          pnpm lint
          pnpm type-check
          ```
        -   **Verification**: All commands must complete successfully without reporting any errors. This confirms that the codebase adheres to the project's quality standards as defined in `.prettierrc` and `eslint.config.js`.

    -   **Step 6: Build the Project**
        -   **Action**: Compile the entire project and generate TypeScript declaration files.
          ```bash
          pnpm build --withTypes
          ```
        -   **Verification**: The build process should finish without errors. Verify that `dist/` directories containing build artifacts (e.g., `*.esm-bundler.js`, `*.cjs.js`, `*.d.ts`, `*.d.mts`) have been created within the `packages/` subdirectories.

    -   **Step 7: Run All Test Suites**
        -   **Action**: Execute the complete test suite to ensure correctness and stability.
          ```bash
          # Run unit tests
          pnpm test-unit

          # Run end-to-end tests (requires headless Chromium)
          pnpm test-e2e

          # Run TypeScript definition tests
          pnpm test-dts
          ```
        -   **Verification**: All test suites should pass. A successful `test-e2e` run confirms that Puppeteer is able to launch the installed Chromium browser correctly in the headless environment.

    -   **Step 8: Verify Development Server Startup**
        -   **Action**: Run the `dev` script to ensure the development server can start without issues.
          ```bash
          pnpm dev
          ```
        -   **Verification**: The server should start up and log a message to the console indicating it is running. The process should not exit with an error code. In a CI environment, you may need to run this command in the background and then terminate it.

    -   **Step 9: Verify Git Hooks (Local Development Context)**
        -   **Action**: This step is primarily for developers' local machines. The underlying scripts (`lint-staged`, type checks) are already verified in Step 5 for the CI environment.
        -   **Verification**: On a local machine, making a commit (`git commit`) should trigger the `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks, which must pass for the commit to succeed. This confirms the local development guardrails are working.

    -   **Step 10: Perform a Release (for Maintainers)**
        -   **Action**: This process is initiated from a maintainer's local machine, not the CI server. The maintainer runs the release script, which creates a version bump commit and a new Git tag (e.g., `v3.4.0`).
          ```bash
          # On a maintainer's local machine
          pnpm release
          git push --follow-tags
          ```
        -   **Verification**: Pushing the tag to the remote repository triggers the automated "Release" workflow (e.g., on GitHub Actions). This workflow must run all tests and publishing steps successfully in its own clean `linux/amd64` environment.

    -   **Step 11 (Optional): Verify Deployment Configuration**
        -   **Action**: Use the Netlify CLI to simulate a production build within the target environment.
          ```bash
          # Install Netlify CLI if not already present
          # pnpm add -g netlify-cli

          # Run a production build as Netlify would
          netlify build
          ```
        -   **Verification**: The command should execute successfully, respecting the build settings in `netlify.toml`. The specified output directory should contain the final static assets ready for deployment.
