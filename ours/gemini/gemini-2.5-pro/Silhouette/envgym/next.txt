current progress
The Dockerfile successfully automates the environment setup and build process described in the plan. It resolves the previous build failure by correctly adding external package repositories before installing version-specific dependencies like Python 3.10 and LLVM 15. The build process now includes the compilation of all required tools, LLVM passes, kernel modules, and workloads, with verification steps to ensure all artifacts are created correctly. Configuration files are properly modified, and the required NVDIMM backing file is created, making the environment fully prepared for the runtime testing and evaluation phases.

next step
The large `RUN` instruction for system package installation is monolithic, which is inefficient for build caching. A failure in a later part of the command, such as the kernel header installation, forces all preceding `apt` package installations to re-run. Modify the Dockerfile by splitting this single `RUN` command into multiple, logically distinct layers. Specifically, create separate `RUN` instructions for: 1) installing packages from `apt` repositories, 2) downloading and installing the kernel header `.deb` packages, and 3) installing `pip`. This will improve build performance and debugging speed by leveraging Docker's layer caching more effectively.
