current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the environment setup described in the plan. It correctly installs system prerequisites, clones the specified Git repository, installs all Python dependencies with the required CPU-only versions for PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric, and creates the necessary `data` and `outputs` directories. The environment setup phase is complete.

next step
Add a build step to the Dockerfile to create and run the `check_env.py` script as defined in the plan's "Environment Verification Test". This will automate the verification of library versions and CPU compatibility, ensuring the integrity of the built image.
