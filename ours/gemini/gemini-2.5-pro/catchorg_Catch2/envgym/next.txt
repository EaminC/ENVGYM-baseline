current progress
A comprehensive Dockerfile has been developed based on the project plan, addressing the package installation failures of a previous, simpler version. This new file correctly adds the necessary PPA and LLVM repositories to source a wide range of GCC and Clang compilers. It also automates the setup of isolated Conan 1.x/2.x environments, creates a non-root user, and pre-populates the workspace with source code and verification project files as specified in the plan.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to align it completely with the plan's software requirements. First, add the missing `clang-6.0`, `clang-7`, and `ccache` packages to the `apt-get install` command. Second, remove `meson` from the `apt-get` installation, as the Ubuntu 20.04 repository version (0.53.2) is older than the required version (>=0.54.1). Instead, install a compliant version of Meson using `pip3`.
