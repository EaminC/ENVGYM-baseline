current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the environment setup and compilation stages outlined in "Method B: Build from Source" of the plan. It correctly installs all specified prerequisites for Ubuntu 24.04, clones the source code with submodules, acquires the ANTLR v3 dependency, creates the necessary VERSION file, and compiles both the `debug` and `release` configurations of the `ponyc` compiler. The build environment is fully prepared, and the compiled release binary has been added to the system PATH.

next step
The next step is to add the verification stages from the plan to the Dockerfile to ensure the builds are correct. This involves adding `RUN` instructions to execute the test suites for both the `debug` and `release` builds using the `make test-ci` command, as specified in steps 7 and 9 of "Method B". This will validate the integrity and functionality of the compiled artifacts, completing the core build-from-source process.
