current progress
The Dockerfile has been created and aligns with the core requirements of the plan, including using the correct base image, installing `build-essential` and Python packages from `requirements.txt`, and making shell scripts executable. The previous log indicates a successful Docker build, confirming the environment is functional. The current Dockerfile differs from the plan by adding a `CMD ["/bin/bash"]` instruction, which sets a default command that was not specified in the plan.

next step
Remove the final line `CMD ["/bin/bash"]` from the Dockerfile. The plan is designed to execute specific scripts via `docker run` commands, and a default `CMD` is unnecessary and deviates from the specified configuration. This change will bring the Dockerfile into full compliance with the plan before proceeding to the build and verification steps.
