current progress
The Dockerfile successfully automates the environment setup outlined in steps 1-4 of the plan. It uses a multi-stage build to install all specified system prerequisites, including the optional `wrk` tool. It correctly configures the workspace, creates the `.npmrc` file to prevent lock file generation, and installs all project dependencies using `npm install`. The resulting image contains a complete and configured environment ready for executing the project's test and validation scripts.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to automate the project's core verification steps. After the `COPY . .` instruction, add `RUN npm run lint` and `RUN npm run test-ci` to execute the linter and the main test suite during the image build process. This will ensure that the built image is verified against the project's quality and correctness standards.
