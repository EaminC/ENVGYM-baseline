- Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/simdjson_simdjson
- Architecture: x86_64, --platform linux/amd64
- Base Image: Standard linux/amd64 images (e.g., ubuntu:20.04, debian, alpine).
- GPU: Not available. CUDA-based images are not required for runtime.
- Instruction Notes: COPY/ADD paths are relative to the working directory. High core count (96) is suitable for parallel build steps. Limited free storage (62.1GB) suggests using multi-stage builds and cleaning build artifacts.
- Docker Version: 28.1.1, BuildKit is enabled by default.
