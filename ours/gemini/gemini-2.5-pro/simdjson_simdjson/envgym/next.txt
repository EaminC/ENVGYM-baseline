current progress
The current Dockerfile successfully creates a comprehensive development and build environment based on Ubuntu 22.04. It correctly installs all specified prerequisites, including C++ toolchains, Rust, Node.js, and various development utilities. It clones the source code, installs JavaScript dependencies, and performs a complete debug build of the library along with its tests and examples using CMake and Ninja. The resulting image contains a fully compiled project, ready for interactive use.

next step
The next step is to add validation and verification layers to the Dockerfile. Currently, it only builds the project but does not run any tests. A `RUN ctest` command should be added after the build step to execute the unit and integration test suite, ensuring the compiled code is functional. To further align with the project's quality assurance goals, the Dockerfile should also incorporate steps to test the installation process (`RUN cmake --install`) and run post-installation checks to verify that the library is usable by downstream consumers via `pkg-config` and CMake's `find_package`.
