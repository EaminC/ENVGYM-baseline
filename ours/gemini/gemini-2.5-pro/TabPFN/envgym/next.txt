current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements all environment setup steps from the plan. It installs system prerequisites (Python, Git), copies the source code, initializes git submodules, creates and activates a Python virtual environment, installs all required development dependencies, creates the `.env` configuration file, and pre-downloads the model weights. The build process is complete and successful, but it currently lacks any verification or testing stages.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to include validation and testing stages. Add `RUN` commands to execute the key verification steps from the plan to ensure the environment's integrity. The primary additions should be running the basic functionality check (`python verify_install.py`) and executing the full test suite (`pytest tests/`). Optionally, add steps for static analysis (`ruff check .`, `mypy src/tabpfen`) and documentation builds (`mkdocs build`) for a more comprehensive validation pipeline.
