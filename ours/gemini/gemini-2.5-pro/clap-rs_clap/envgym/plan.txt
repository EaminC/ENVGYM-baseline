     - **`.github/workflows/spelling.yml`**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow to run a spell check using `typos` on every pull request, providing fast feedback on spelling errors.
     - **`.github/workflows/committed.yml`**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow that lints all commit messages in a pull request to ensure they conform to the Conventional Commits specification. This provides a more robust check than the local `pre-commit` hook.
     - **`.github/workflows/rust-next.yml`**: A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow for testing the codebase against `beta` and `nightly` Rust toolchains on multiple operating systems. It also includes a job to test against the latest possible dependency versions by running `cargo update`, ensuring forward compatibility.
     - **`.github/workflows/post-release.yml`**: A GitHub Actions workflow that automatically creates a GitHub Release, including generating release notes from commit history, whenever a new version tag is pushed.
     - **`.github/workflows/bench-baseline.yml`**: A GitHub Actions workflow that tracks the binary size of specific examples (e.g., `git-derive`) on every push to the `master` branch using the `bencher` tool.
     - **`.github/workflows/release-notes.py`**: A Python script used by the `post-release.yml` workflow to generate release notes.
     - **`.github/renovate.json5`**: Configures the Renovate bot to automatically update dependencies. It is set up to update the stable Rust toolchain version across the repository and auto-merge updates for development dependencies.
     - **`.github/settings.yml`**: Configures the GitHub repository settings via the Probot Settings app. It defines repository metadata, branch protection rules, and pull request merge behavior (e.g., allowing merge commits and enabling auto-merge).
     - **`.cargo/config.toml`**: Configures Cargo's dependency resolver to be more flexible with Rust toolchain versions (`incompatible-rust-versions = "fallback"`).
     - **`.clippy.toml`**: Configures custom `clippy` lints for the project to enforce specific coding standards.
     - **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**: Configures `pre-commit` hooks for automatic checks (e.g., formatting, spelling, commit message style).
     - **`deny.toml`**: Configures `cargo-deny` to enforce policies on dependency licenses, security advisories, and sourcing.
     - **`release.toml`**: Configures `cargo-release` for automated publishing, defining crate owners, allowed branches, and versioning strategies.
     - **`typos.toml`**: Configures the `typos-cli` spell checker, defining files to exclude and a custom dictionary of accepted words.
     - **`committed.toml`**: Configures the `committed` tool to enforce the Conventional Commits specification, ignoring commits from automation bots like `dependabot` and `renovate`.
     - **`CITATION.cff`**: A Citation File Format file used to make the software easily citable. Its validity is checked in CI.
   - The project source code is located in the directories of the respective member crates (e.g., `clap_builder/`, `clap_derive/`, `clap_lex/`, `clap_complete/`, `clap_complete_nushell/`, `clap_mangen/`, `clap_bench/`). Each member crate, such as `clap_derive`, `clap_complete`, `clap_lex`, `clap_mangen`, and `clap_complete_nushell`, contains its own `README.md` file detailing its specific role. For example, `clap_derive/README.md` explains the macro implementation, `clap_complete/README.md` covers general shell completion generation, `clap_lex/README.md` introduces the minimal, flexible command line parser, `clap_mangen/README.md` details how to generate ROFF manpages from a `clap::Command`, and `clap_complete_nushell/README.md` explains how to generate completions specifically for the Nushell.
   - The `tests/` directory contains integration and UI tests for the command-line behavior of examples. These tests are often defined in `.toml` files (e.g., `tests/ui/arg_required_else_help_stderr.toml`, `tests/ui/error_stderr.toml`, `tests/ui/h_flag_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/V_flag_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/version_flag_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/help_cmd_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/help_flag_stdout.toml`) and executed by `trycmd` to assert on exit codes, `stdout`, and `stderr`.

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
   - **Unit and Integration Tests with Feature Combinations**: The `Makefile` provides targets to run tests against a wide range of feature flag configurations verified in CI, including `minimal`, `default`, `full`, `next`, `debug`, and `release`.
   - **Shell Completion Integration Tests**: A dedicated test suite, enabled by the `unstable-shell-tests` feature, validates generated completion scripts for various shells (`elvish`, `fish`, `zsh`, `nushell`) using external tools like `completest`.
   - **UI Tests (Compile-time)**: `trybuild` tests in `clap_derive` ensure that procedural macros produce correct code and helpful error messages. These are run with the specific stable Rust toolchain defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
   - **UI Tests for CLI Behavior (Runtime)**: The project uses `trycmd` extensively to run integration tests against example binaries. These tests, defined in `.toml` files within the `tests/` directory (like `tests/ui/error_stderr.toml`, `tests/ui/h_flag_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/V_flag_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/version_flag_stdout.toml`, `tests/ui/help_cmd_stdout.toml`, and `tests/ui/help_flag_stdout.toml`), verify the full application behavior by asserting on exit codes, `stdout`, and `stderr`. This serves as a form of snapshot testing for the command-line interface itself, ensuring help messages, errors, and outputs remain consistent.
   - **Performance Benchmarks**: The `clap_bench` crate contains `divan` benchmarks to measure parsing performance and prevent regressions. The test suite is also run *within* the benchmark crates (`--benches`) as part of CI to ensure their test-only code remains valid.
   - **Binary Size Benchmarking**: A CI job on the `master` branch tracks the file size of compiled, stripped release examples (e.g., `git-derive`) using the `bencher` tool to prevent unexpected increases in binary size.
   - **WebAssembly (Wasm) Compatibility Checks**: Specific build targets (`check-wasm`) verify that the crate compiles correctly for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasip2` targets.
   - **Minimal Versions Check**: A CI job uses the `nightly` toolchain with the `-Z minimal-versions` flag to generate a `Cargo.lock` file with the lowest possible compatible dependency versions, ensuring the project's specified version requirements are correct.
   - **Snapshot Tests for Generated Outputs**: Crates like `clap_mangen` use `snapbox` for snapshot testing to verify generated files, such as ensuring the correctness of ROFF manpages.
   - **Documentation Build Tests**: The documentation build is run with `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"` to ensure all code examples and doc comments compile without warnings.
   - **Linting and Formatting Checks**: Strict `clippy` lints and `rustfmt` formatting are enforced across multiple feature sets (`minimal`, `full`, `release`) and are treated as errors.
   - **Security Vulnerability Audit**: A dedicated CI job runs `cargo audit` to check for dependencies with known security vulnerabilities.
   - **Dependency Policy Audits**: `cargo-deny` checks all dependencies for security vulnerabilities (advisories), license compliance, unwanted versions (bans), and approved sources.
   - **Forward-Compatibility Checks (Beta/Nightly Toolchains)**: A scheduled CI job (`rust-next.yml`) regularly tests the entire suite against the `beta` and `nightly` Rust toolchains across Linux, Windows, and macOS to catch regressions before a new Rust version is released. Failures on these toolchains are permitted but monitored.
   - **Latest Dependency Compatibility Check**: The scheduled `rust-next.yml` workflow runs the full test suite after updating all dependencies to their latest compatible versions (`cargo update`), ensuring the project remains compatible with the evolving ecosystem.
   - **Automated Dependency Update Validation**: The entire CI pipeline is run against pull requests opened by Renovate bot, ensuring that automated updates to the Rust toolchain and dev-dependencies do not cause regressions.
   - **Lockfile Check**: CI verifies that the `Cargo.lock` file is consistent with `Cargo.toml` and does not require an update.
   - **`pre-commit` Hook Validation (CI)**: A dedicated CI job runs `pre-commit run --all-files` to enforce repository-wide checks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. This includes code formatting (`rustfmt`), spell checking (with `typos-cli` configured by `typos.toml`), and file validation. This ensures all contributions adhere to project standards before merging.
   - **Dedicated Spell Check (Pull Request)**: A dedicated CI workflow (`spelling.yml`) runs the `typos` spell checker on every pull request to ensure all text-based files, including source code and documentation, are free of spelling errors. This is a mandatory check.
   - **Commit Message Linting (Pull Request)**: A dedicated CI workflow (`committed.yml`) runs on every pull request to ensure every commit message in the PR adheres to the Conventional Commits specification. This is a mandatory check for merging contributions.
   - **Citation File Validation**: The `CITATION.cff` file is validated in CI to ensure it is correctly formatted.
   - **Pull Request Merge Gates**: Branch protection rules, managed via `.github/settings.yml`, enforce that all mandatory CI checks (e.g., the main `CI` workflow, `Spell Check`) must pass before a pull request can be merged into the `master` branch. The repository is configured to automatically delete branches after merging.
   - **Automated GitHub Release Creation**: A post-release workflow automatically triggers when a version tag is pushed. It uses a custom script (`release-notes.py`) to generate release notes from the commit history and then creates a formal GitHub Release, ensuring consistency and automating a key part of the release process.

All commands should execute successfully.

   - **Step 2: Get the Source Code**
     - Action: Ensure the project source code is available in your working directory. If not, clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/clap-rs/clap.git`.
     - Action: Change into the project directory: `cd clap`.
     - Verification: List the directory contents. You should see `Makefile`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE-APACHE`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `.gitignore`, `.github/renovate.json5`, `.github/settings.yml`, `.github/workflows/post-release.yml`, `.github/workflows/committed.yml`, `.github/workflows/spelling.yml`, `.github/workflows/rust-next.yml`, `.github/workflows/bench-baseline.yml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `CITATION.cff`, `deny.toml`, `release.toml`, `typos.toml`, `committed.toml`, workspace `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and directories for the member crates like `clap_builder/`, `clap_derive/`, `clap_lex/`, `clap_complete/`, `clap_complete_nushell/`, and `clap_mangen/`, and the `tests/` directory which contains files like `tests/ui/V_flag_stdout.toml` and `tests/ui/version_flag_stdout.toml`. Each of these member crate directories will contain its own `README.md`, including `clap_mangen/README.md` and `clap_complete_nushell/README.md`.

   - **Step 3: Install Git Hooks**
     - Action: Inside the `clap` repository, set up the pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install --install-hooks`.
     - Verification: The command should report that `pre-commit` and `commit-msg` hooks were installed. Your first commit will trigger the installation of the hook environments.

   - **Step 4: Build the Entire Workspace**
     - Action: Compile all crates and dependencies with the default feature set: `make build-default`. This runs `cargo test --no-run`. Note: This command, along with other `cargo` and `make` tasks, will automatically utilize all available CPU cores for parallel compilation, taking full advantage of the build environment's high core count.
     - Verification: The command should complete without errors, and a `target` directory will be created. This directory is ignored by Git as per the `.gitignore` file.

   - **Step 5: Run Core Test Suites**
     - Action: Execute all unit and integration tests for the "full" feature set: `make test-full`.
     - Action: Run the compile-time UI tests for the derive macros using the correct toolchain: `make test-ui-default`.
     - Action: Run the runtime UI tests which verify CLI output and behavior: `cargo test --test ui`.
     - Action: Run the snapshot tests for manpage generation: `cargo test -p clap_mangen`.

     - Verification: All test suites should complete with a summary of all tests passing.

   - **Step 6: Run Performance Benchmarks**
     - Action: Run the benchmark suite: `cargo bench -p clap_bench`.
     - Verification: Benchmarks should run and print a summary of results.

   - **Step 7: Run All Code Quality and CI Checks**
     - Action: Run the linter with the "full" feature set: `make clippy-full`.
     - Action: Check for correct formatting: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`.
     - Action: Run dependency policy audits: `cargo deny check all`.
     - Action: Run security vulnerability audit: `cargo audit`.
     - Action: Check compatibility with latest dependency versions: `cargo update` followed by `make test-full`. Restore the original lockfile with `git restore Cargo.lock` afterward.
     - Action: Check compatibility with minimal dependency versions: `cargo +nightly generate-lockfile -Z minimal-versions` followed by `cargo +stable check --workspace --all-features --locked --exclude clap_complete_nushell --exclude clap_bench`. Restore the original lockfile with `git restore Cargo.lock` afterward.
     - Action: Check if the lockfile is up-to-date: `cargo update --workspace --locked`.
     - Action: Check compilation for the MSRV: `cargo +1.74 check --workspace --features full`.
     - Action: Check compilation against the beta toolchain: `cargo +beta check --workspace --features full`.
     - Action: Check compilation for Wasm: `make check-wasm`.
     - Action: Run tests within benchmark crates: `make test-full ARGS='--workspace --benches'`.
     - Action: Build an example binary with stripping to check its size: `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_STRIP=true cargo build --package clap --example git-derive -F derive --release`.
     - Action: Run all `pre-commit` checks on all files to simulate the CI job: `pre-commit run --all-files`.
     - Verification: All commands should complete without reporting any issues.

   - **Step 8: Build the Documentation**
     - Action: Generate the documentation with strict checks: `make doc`. This uses `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`.
     - Verification: The command should complete without errors. Documentation is in `target/doc/`.

   - **Step 9: Prepare Your Contribution and Commits**
     - Action: Write your commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat(derive): Add new attribute`).
     - Verification: When you run `git commit`, the `commit-msg` hook installed in Step 3 will automatically check your message. In addition to this local check, be aware that a dedicated CI job (`committed.yml`) will validate every commit message in your pull request. The commit will be blocked locally or the CI will fail if checks fail.

   - **Step 10: Explore and Debug**
     - Action: Run an example: `cargo run --example 01_quick_derive -- --name "Contributor"`.
     - Verification: The program should compile, run, and print "Hello, Contributor!".
     - Action: Run tests for a specific feature combination, like `minimal`: `make test-minimal`.
     - Verification: The minimal test suite should pass.
     - Action: Run checks for a specific configuration, like `debug`: `make check-debug`.
     - Verification: The check should pass successfully.
     - Action (Optional, for debugging): To see clap's internal debug output, use the `debug` feature flag: `cargo test --features debug`.
     - Verification: Test output will include detailed debug information.

   - **Step 11: Perform a Release (Maintainers Only)**
     - Action: Perform a dry run of the release process to preview changes: `cargo release --dry-run <level>`, where `<level>` is `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.
     - Verification: The dry run should complete without errors, showing the planned actions like version bumps and git tags without actually executing them.
     - Action (For actual release): Run `cargo release <level>` from an allowed branch (e.g., `master`).
     - Verification: The new version is published to crates.io, and a new tag is created and pushed to the repository. Once the tag is pushed, the `post-release` GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run, generating release notes and creating a corresponding GitHub Release.
