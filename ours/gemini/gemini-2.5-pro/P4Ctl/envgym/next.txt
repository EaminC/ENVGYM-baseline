current progress
A multi-stage Dockerfile has been successfully created and built. This file automates the setup of a base image with all common dependencies (Python, build tools, Scapy) and pre-builds the `netcl` policy compiler. It further creates specialized images for the `switch` (with Tofino SDE environment variables set) and `host` (with eBPF/BCC tools installed) roles. This completes most of the software installation and initial compilation tasks from the plan (Phases 1, 3, and 5) within the image build process.

next step
To further automate the setup and minimize manual configuration within running containers, the Dockerfile should be modified. In the `host` stage, add a `RUN` command using `sed` to permanently change the network interface name to `"eth0"` in the `host_agent/host_agent.py` file. Additionally, in the `switch` stage, add a `RUN` command to execute the P4 build script (`./p4_build.sh -p switch/p4control.p4`) to pre-compile the P4 program.
