Based on the provided hardware and environment information, which strongly indicates a containerized setup using Docker, the original plan requires significant adjustments to ensure feasibility. The following revised plan is tailored for an `x86_64` architecture using Docker containers on a Linux host, replacing physical multi-host dependencies with a simulated container network and a software switch model instead of hardware drivers.

***

### **ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN**

**Context:** This plan is adapted for a containerized environment managed by Docker. The "Switch Management Machine" and "Hosts" (Host1, Host2, Host3) will be run as separate Docker containers. The working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/P4Ctl` is the Docker build context.

1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
    *   **Base Docker Image:** `ubuntu:22.04` (LTS). This is recommended over 20.04 to ensure a more recent host kernel is available, which is critical for eBPF/BCC compatibility with kernel versions like 5.15.0+. Docker containers share the host's kernel.
    *   **P4 Switch Software:** Tofino Switch SDE 9.7.0 (Requires access from Intel/Barefoot). For this containerized environment, we will use the **Tofino behavioral model (`modeld`)** included in the SDE, not the physical hardware driver (`switchd`).
    *   **eBPF Toolchain:** BCC (Bionic Compiler Collection). Must be compatible with the **host machine's Linux Kernel**.
    *   **Programming Language:** Python 3.7.
    *   **Python Libraries:** Scapy 2.4.5.
    *   **Compiler Tools:** Bison 3.8.2, Flex 2.6.4, `g++` (from `build-essential`), `libfl-dev`.
    *   **Networking Tools:** `ncat` (from `nmap`), `iproute2` (for `ip a`).
    *   **Source Code:** The P4Control project repository from `https://github.com/peng-gao-lab/p4control`.

2.  FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY (Within the Container Filesystem):
    *   **File to Modify:** `host_agent/host_agent.py`
        *   **Path:** Within the cloned `p4control` repository, on each of the three "host" containers.
        *   **Description:** This file must be edited to specify the correct network interface name. In a standard Docker container network, this is typically **`"eth0"`**. Search for the interface name variable and update its value accordingly.

    *   **File to Modify (Dynamically):** `host_agent/host_agent_ebpf.c`
        *   **Path:** Within the cloned `p4control` repository, on each of the three "host" containers.
        *   **Description:** Before running the host agent, the `TAGGED_TERMINAL` macro must be updated with the PID of the shell process *inside the specific container*. This is found by running `ps` after attaching to the container's shell.

    *   **File to Modify (for Custom Policies):** `switch/netcl.py`
        *   **Path:** Within the cloned `p4control` repository, in the "switch" container.
        *   **Description:** To apply custom network policies, compile them using the `netcl-compile` tool. The output must be copied into this Python file, replacing the existing rules.

    *   **File to Create (Executable):** `compiler/netcl-compile`
        *   **Path:** Within the cloned `p4control` repository, in the `compiler/` subdirectory inside the "switch" container.
        *   **Description:** This compiler executable is built from source using the provided Makefile. It must be built before the switch controller can be run with custom policies.

3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
    *   **(No changes)** The logic of the test cases remains the same, but they will be executed between containers on a Docker network instead of between physical hosts.

4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
    *   **Phase 1: Docker Image and Environment Preparation (On Host Machine)**
        1.  **Create a Dockerfile:** In a new directory, create a `Dockerfile` to build a base image with all common dependencies.
            ```Dockerfile
            # Use Ubuntu 22.04 for better kernel compatibility for eBPF
            FROM ubuntu:22.04

            # Avoid interactive prompts during build
            ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

            # Install common dependencies and add repository for Python 3.7
            RUN apt-get update && \
                apt-get install -y software-properties-common && \
                add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && \
                apt-get update && \
                apt-get install -y git python3.7 python3.7-distutils python3.7-dev nmap build-essential libfl-dev iproute2 curl && \
                rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

            # Install pip for Python 3.7
            RUN curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py && \
                python3.7 get-pip.py && \
                rm get-pip.py

            # Install required Python library
            RUN python3.7 -m pip install scapy==2.4.5

            # Set a working directory
            WORKDIR /root
            ```
        2.  **Build the Base Docker Image:**
            ```bash
            docker build -t p4control-base .
            ```
        3.  **Prepare Project and SDE:**
            *   Clone the P4Control project into the build context directory: `git clone https://github.com/peng-gao-lab/p4control /home/cc/EnvGym/data/P4Ctl`.
            *   Download and extract the Tofino SDE 9.7.0 into the build context as well, so it can be copied into the switch container.
        4.  **Create Docker Network:** Create a dedicated network for the containers to communicate.
            ```bash
            docker network create --subnet=10.0.0.0/24 p4control-net
            ```

    *   **Phase 2: Launch Containers**
        1.  **Launch the Switch Container:** This container will run the Tofino model and the controller.
            ```bash
            docker run -itd --name p4switch --net p4control-net -v /home/cc/EnvGym/data/P4Ctl:/root/p4control --cap-add=ALL --privileged p4control-base
            ```
        2.  **Launch the Host Containers:**
            ```bash
            docker run -itd --name host1 --net p4control-net --ip 10.0.0.1 -v /home/cc/EnvGym/data/P4Ctl:/root/p4control --cap-add=ALL --privileged p4control-base
            docker run -itd --name host2 --net p4control-net --ip 10.0.0.2 -v /home/cc/EnvGym/data/P4Ctl:/root/p4control --cap-add=ALL --privileged p4control-base
            docker run -itd --name host3 --net p4control-net --ip 10.0.0.3 -v /home/cc/EnvGym/data/P4Ctl:/root/p4control --cap-add=ALL --privileged p4control-base
            ```
        3.  **Verification:**
            ```bash
            docker ps # Should show p4switch, host1, host2, and host3 running
            ```

    *   **Phase 3: Tofino SDE and Host Environment Setup**
        1.  **On the Switch Container (`p4switch`):**
            *   Copy the SDE into the container (if not mounted via volume) and install it according to vendor instructions.
            *   Set environment variables. It's best to do this by attaching to the container:
                ```bash
                docker exec -it p4switch bash
                # Inside the container:
                echo 'export SDE=/path/to/bf-sde-9.7.0/' >> ~/.bashrc
                echo 'export SDE_INSTALL=/path/to/bf-sde-9.7.0/install' >> ~/.bashrc
                source ~/.bashrc
                exit
                ```
        2.  **On Each Host Container (`host1`, `host2`, `host3`):**
            *   Attach to the container: `docker exec -it <container_name> bash`.
            *   Install build tools (Bison, Flex) and BCC as described in the original plan. The host's kernel must be compatible.
            *   Configure Host Agent: Edit `/root/p4control/host_agent/host_agent.py` and set the interface name to `"eth0"`.

    *   **Phase 4: Build P4 Program and Start Switch Simulator (in `p4switch` container)**
        1.  Attach to the switch container: `docker exec -it p4switch bash`.
        2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd /root/p4control`.
        3.  Build the P4 program: `./p4_build.sh -p switch/p4control.p4`.
        4.  Run the **Tofino behavioral model** in the background.
            ```bash
            ./run_tofino_model.sh -p p4control &
            ```
        5.  **Verification:** The model should be running without errors.

    *   **Phase 5: Compile Policy and Run Controller (in `p4switch` container)**
        1.  While still inside the `p4switch` container, navigate to `compiler`: `cd compiler`.
        2.  Build the policy compiler: `make netcl`.
        3.  Compile the policy and copy the output rules.
        4.  Paste the new rules into `switch/netcl.py`.
        5.  Navigate to the project root and start the controller:
            ```bash
            cd ..
            python3.7 switch/controller.py
            ```
        6.  **Verification:** The controller should log its connection to the switch model and the insertion of rules.

    *   **Phase 6: Deploy Host Agents (in `host1`, `host2`, `host3` containers)**
        1.  For each host container (e.g., `host1`):
            *   Attach an interactive shell: `docker exec -it host1 bash`.
            *   Get the PID of this shell: `ps`. Note the PID for the `bash` process.
            *   Edit `/root/p4control/host_agent/host_agent_ebpf.c` and set `TAGGED_TERMINAL` to this PID.
            *   In the same shell, run the agent: `sudo python3.7 host_agent/host_agent.py`.
        2.  **Verification:** The agent should start without eBPF compilation or attachment errors.
        3.  Repeat this process for `host2` and `host3` in separate terminal windows.

    *   **Phase 7: Execute Verification Test Case**
        1.  **On Host2 and Host3:** In the shells where the agents are running, start `ncat` listeners.
            ```bash
            # In host2's attached shell
            sudo ncat -nlvp 9999 -e /bin/bash
            # In host3's attached shell
            sudo ncat -nlvp 9999 -e /bin/bash
            ```
        2.  **On Host1:** In its attached shell, connect to Host2.
            ```bash
            sudo ncat 10.0.0.2 9999
            ```
        3.  **Verification:** You should get a shell prompt from Host2 inside the Host1 terminal.
        4.  **From the session on Host1 (now connected to Host2):** Attempt to connect to Host3.
            ```bash
            ncat 10.0.0.3 9999
            ```
        5.  **Final Verification:** This connection must fail (hang or timeout). This confirms the P4Control policy, enforced by the Tofino model, has correctly blocked the prohibited information flow between containers.
