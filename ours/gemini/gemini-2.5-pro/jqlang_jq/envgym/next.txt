current progress
The current Dockerfile successfully prepares a comprehensive development environment. It installs all required system dependencies for various build scenarios (native, cross-compile, documentation, static analysis, debugging), clones the source code repository, initializes the necessary submodules, installs Python dependencies, and generates the initial build system configuration scripts. The image provides a user with an interactive shell inside the prepared source tree, ready to manually execute any of the build and test methods outlined in the plan.

next step
Transition the Dockerfile from a general-purpose development environment to an automated, multi-stage build process as described in the plan's `Dockerfile.build` example. This involves adding `RUN` instructions to execute the `./configure`, `make`, and `make check` commands within a builder stage. Then, create a minimal final stage (`FROM scratch`) and use a `COPY --from=builder` instruction to copy only the compiled static `jq` binary and license files into the final image, setting an appropriate `ENTRYPOINT`.
