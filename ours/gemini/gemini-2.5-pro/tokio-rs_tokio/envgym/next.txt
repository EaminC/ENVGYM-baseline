current progress
A comprehensive Dockerfile has been created based on the setup plan, incorporating system prerequisite installation, Rust toolchain setup, and a dependency caching layer. A previous execution failed during the `apt-get install` step, as shown in the build log. The current Dockerfile uses a more complete package list in an attempt to resolve this foundational step.

next step
To improve the robustness of the prerequisite installation and prevent potential failures caused by outdated base image repositories, modify the `RUN` command for package installation. Add `apt-get upgrade -y` after `apt-get update` to ensure all base system packages are up-to-date before installing the project's specific dependencies.
