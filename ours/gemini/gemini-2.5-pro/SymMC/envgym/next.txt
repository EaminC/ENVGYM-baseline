current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the environment setup and compilation stages from the plan. It correctly installs all system dependencies, including OpenJDK 8, Ant, and the C++ build toolchain with its libraries (GMP, ZLIB). It proceeds to compile both the `Enhanced_Kodkod` (Java) and `Enumerator_Estimator` (C++) modules, creating the necessary build artifacts as specified. The Docker image currently provides a fully built but unverified environment.

next step
Add a build-time verification stage to the Dockerfile. Incorporate the test cases from the plan (Steps 7 and 8) as `RUN` instructions. This will execute the end-to-end workflow test and the tests with pre-generated datasets, ensuring that the compiled artifacts are functional and the environment is correctly configured within the image itself. This step will validate the integrity of the build process automatically.
