current progress
The Dockerfile successfully completes all of "Part A" of the plan. It installs system prerequisites, clones the source code, and then builds, tests, installs, and verifies the library with a sample project. It also prepares the environment for "Part B" by installing all Python dependencies and the CodeQL CLI, and by configuring a CI-enabled build directory (`build-ci`). However, it does not yet execute the advanced CI checks.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to execute the remaining verification and analysis tasks from "Part B" of the plan. Add `RUN` commands to build the static analysis and formatting targets (Step 11: `ci_astyle`, `ci_clang_tidy`), packaging and compliance targets (Step 12), the documentation (Step 16), and to run the advanced checks like CodeQL analysis (Step 13) and Valgrind memory safety tests (Step 14). This will ensure the environment is not only set up but also fully validated against the project's quality standards.
