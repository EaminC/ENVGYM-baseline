=== Iteration 1 - [2025-08-29 04:26:54] ===
PLAN:
  Here is the complete environment setup plan, adjusted for your specified hardware and containerized Linux environment.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **C++ Compiler**: A compiler with C++11 support or newer, to be installed via the system's package manager.
          *   Examples: GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.4+.
          *   **Specific C++ Standard Requirements**:
              *   **C++17 Support**: Requires GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   **C++20 Support**: Requires GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Note: The CI system tests an extensive range of versions, including GCC up to 15 and Clang up to 20.
      *   **Build System**: At least one of the following is required.
          *   **CMake**: Version **3.13 or newer**.
              *   Note: The latest version is used in CI and is recommended.
              *   Note: Version 3.28+ is required to enable the optional C++ Modules feature (`NLOHMANN_JSON_BUILD_MODULES`).
          *   **Meson**: Version 0.50 or newer.
          *   **Bazel**: Version 6.0+ is recommended for modern Bzlmod support. `bazelisk` is the recommended installer.
      *   **Build System Generator**: A tool to build the configured project.
          *   Examples: Make, Ninja (recommended for some Makefile targets and as the default for Meson and some CI jobs).
      *   **nlohmann/json Source Code**: The complete source code for the library, version 3.12.0. It will be located in the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      *   **Git (Recommended)**: For cloning the source code repository.
      *   **Standard Unix Tools**: `wget`, `tar`, `unzip`, `locales`. May be required for downloading dependencies or setting up the environment. Usually pre-installed or available via package manager.
      *   **pkg-config**: Required for library discovery by build systems like Meson after installation. The CMake installation process generates the necessary `nlohmann_json.pc` file for this tool.
      *   **Python 3 and pip (Developer)**: Required for various development and tooling scripts. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage Python dependencies.
          *   Used for: Code formatting, documentation generation (`mkdocs`), REUSE compliance, local development server, static analysis tooling, and other helper scripts.
      *   **Docker (Developer, Recommended)**: For replicating the CI environment using containers like `gcc:latest`, `silkeh/clang:dev`, or `ghcr.io/nlohmann/json-ci:*`.
      *   **Recommended IDEs/Editors (Developer)**: While not required, a properly configured editor enhances productivity.
          *   **Visual Studio Code**: With extensions like `ms-vscode.cpptools`, `ms-vscode.cmake-tools`, and `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`.
          *   **CLion**: Natively supports CMake projects.
      *   **Specialized Tools (Optional, for Advanced Testing/Development)**:
          *   **afl-clang++**: For running fuzz tests.
          *   **Valgrind**: For running memory-checking tests. The test execution is controlled by the `JSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake option.
          *   **lcov**: For generating code coverage reports (`ci_test_coverage`).
          *   **Static Analysis & Formatting Tools**: `cppcheck`, `cpplint`, `clang-tidy`, `clang-format`, `iwyu` (Include What You Use), `infer`, **Artistic Style (AStyle)**.
              *   Note: `clang-tidy` is strictly configured via the `.clang-tidy` file in the repository root, where all warnings are treated as errors.
              *   Note: **AStyle** is used for code formatting, configured via the `.astylerc` file. It can be installed as a native executable or as a Python package (`astyle==3.4.13`) as specified in `tools/astyle/requirements.txt` for tooling scripts.
              *   Note: The `cppcheck` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt`.
              *   Note: The `cpplint` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`.
          *   **LLVM Toolchain (Developer)**: Recommended for developers to obtain tools like `clang-tidy` and `clangd`. Can be installed via the system package manager.
          *   **clangd**: A language server for C++ providing code completion, navigation, and diagnostics, often used with VS Code.
          *   **CodeQL CLI**: For running deep static analysis and security scans, replicating the `codeql-analysis.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.
          *   **Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit**: For building with the Intel C++ Compiler (`icpc`).
          *   **Emscripten SDK**: For compiling to WebAssembly.
          *   **github_changelog_generator**: For generating the ChangeLog file.
          *   **pipx**: For running REUSE compliance tools.

      ### **Key Generated Files (Post-Installation)**
      ---
      -   **`nlohmann_json.pc`**: This file is generated by CMake during the installation process.
          *   Path: `<install-prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc` (or similar, e.g., `share/pkgconfig/`)
          *   Content Description: A file generated from the `pkg-config.pc.in` template. It allows the `pkg-config` tool to provide compiler flags for locating the library's header files. This is the primary mechanism for build systems like Meson to find the library after it has been installed.
          *   Example Content (after generation):
              ```
              prefix=/usr/local
              includedir=${prefix}/include
              Name: nlohmann_json
              Description: JSON for Modern C++
              Version: 3.12.0
              Cflags: -I${includedir}
              ```
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   The project includes a comprehensive, CI-driven test suite. Contributors should run relevant parts of this suite to verify changes.
      *   **Compiler and C++ Standard Conformance**:
          *   Tests are run against a matrix of GCC (4.8+) and Clang (3.4+) versions.
          *   Tests are run for each C++ standard: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, and C++26. This is controlled via the `JSON_TestStandards` CMake variable (e.g., `-DJSON_TestStandards="17;20"`).
          *   **Specific compiler versions are required for newer standards**:
              *   C++17: GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   C++20: GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Clang tests are run with both `libstdc++` and `libc++`.
      *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
          *   **Memory Safety**: `ci_test_valgrind` runs the test suite under Valgrind. This can be enabled locally with the `-DJSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake flag.
          *   **Address/Undefined Behavior Sanitizers**: `ci_test_clang_sanitizer` builds and runs tests with Clang's sanitizers enabled.
          *   **Fuzz Testing**: `ci_fuzz` builds fuzzer executables (e.g., `parse_cbor_fuzzer`) using `afl-clang++`. Running these generates test inputs in `corpus_*` directories to find parsing vulnerabilities.
          *   **Static Analysis**: A suite of targets run various static analysis tools: `ci_cppcheck`, `ci_cpplint`, `ci_clang_tidy`, `ci_clang_analyze`, `ci_infer`. The `ci_clang_tidy` target is a critical quality gate, as it uses the project's `.clang-tidy` configuration file which treats all reported warnings as build-breaking errors. The `ci_cppcheck` and `ci_cpplint` targets rely on specific Python tooling dependencies specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt` and `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`, respectively.
          *   **Code Formatting Conformance**: A dedicated CI target (`ci_astyle`) runs the Artistic Style formatter to check if the codebase adheres to the style defined in `tools/astyle/.astylerc`. This is a critical quality gate to ensure consistent formatting.
          *   **CodeQL Analysis**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`codeql-analysis.yml`) runs CodeQL to perform deep static analysis and security vulnerability scanning on every push and pull request.
      *   **Build Configuration and Feature Variants**:
          *   **CMake Flags**: `ci_cmake_flags` tests various CMake configuration options. Advanced CI replication can use the `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_COMPILE_OPTIONS` and `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_LINK_OPTIONS` environment variables to inject flags.
          *   **Exception Handling**: `ci_test_noexceptions` verifies that the library compiles and runs correctly with exceptions disabled (using `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and compiler flags like `-fno-exceptions`).
          *   **Implicit Conversions**: `ci_test_noimplicitconversions` tests with implicit conversions disabled.
          *   **Fast Tests**: `JSON_FastTests=ON` can be used to skip expensive tests (e.g., the Unicode tests, which have a 3000-second timeout in CI) and speed up build/test cycles.
          *   **Other Variants**: `test-comparison_legacy` (controlled by `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON=1`), `ci_test_noglobaludls`, `ci_test_diagnostics`, `ci_test_diagnostic_positions` test other specific library features and configurations.
      *   **Packaging and Distribution**:
          *   **Amalgamation**: `ci_test_amalgamation` tests the process of combining all source files into a single header.
          *   **Single-Header Usage**: `ci_test_single_header` verifies the amalgamated single header file can be used correctly.
          *   **Reproducibility**: `ci_reproducible_tests` ensures builds are reproducible.
          *   **License Compliance**: `ci_reuse_compliance` checks for REUSE compliance. This check relies on the Python tooling dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt`.
          *   **SBOM Generation**: A CI step may generate a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format (`nlohmann_json.spdx`).
          *   **`pkg-config` Integration**: The installation process is tested to ensure it correctly generates a `nlohmann_json.pc` file. This is implicitly verified by downstream build tests, such as building a Meson project that depends on the installed library, which relies on `pkg-config` for discovery.
      *   **Specialized Environment Builds**:
          *   **C++20 Modules**: `ci_module_cpp20` tests the experimental C++ Modules support with GCC and Clang.
          *   **Intel Compiler**: `ci_icpc` verifies compilation with the Intel C++ Compiler, using flags like `-diag-disable=2196`.
          *   **Emscripten**: Builds the library using the Emscripten toolchain for WebAssembly.
      *   **Documentation and Developer Tooling**:
          *   **Build Documentation**: `ci_test_build_documentation` ensures the documentation can be built successfully using the Python packages specified in `docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt` and the configuration in `docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`. The final output is generated in `docs/mkdocs/site/`.
          *   **Test Examples**: `ci_test_examples` compiles and runs all example code snippets.
          *   **Local Header Server**: A tool (`tools/serve_header`) is available for local development, which likely serves the single-header file and rebuilds it on changes. Its functionality can be manually verified by running it and observing its behavior.
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      This plan is tailored for a Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based) x86_64 containerized environment, leveraging a high core count for parallel operations. The working directory containing the source code is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.

                                 valgrind lcov clang-tools cppcheck pkg-config astyle
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Open a new terminal and run `cmake --version` (must be 3.13+), `g++ --version`, `clang --version`, `git --version`, and `pkg-config --version`.
      -   **Step 2: Set Up Source Code Directory**
          *   **Action:** The source code is expected to be present in the working directory. Navigate into it and check out the specific version tag for a stable installation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # For stable installation, check out the specific version tag.
              git checkout v3.12.0
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The current directory is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json` and it contains `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/astyle/.astylerc`, etc.
      -   **Step 3: Configure the Project with CMake**
          *   **Action:** Create a build directory and run CMake to generate the build files. Enable tests for verification.
              ```bash
              mkdir build-cmake
              cd build-cmake
              # -DJSON_BuildTests=ON enables the test suite
              # -DJSON_FastTests=ON can be added to skip slow tests
              cmake .. -DJSON_BuildTests=ON -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build-cmake` directory is populated with project files (e.g., `build.ninja`). No errors are reported.
      -   **Step 4: Build the Project**
          *   **Action:** Compile the project (specifically the tests) using the high core count available.
              ```bash
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build process completes without errors. Test executables are created.
      -   **Step 5: Run the Test Suite**
          *   **Action:** Execute the tests in parallel using CTest.
              ```bash
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The output shows that 100% of tests passed.
      -   **Step 6: Install the Library**
          *   **Action:** Run the install target.
              ```bash
              # To install to a custom local directory (recommended)
              cmake --install . --prefix "/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              # To install to the system default (e.g., /usr/local)
              cmake --install .
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Check the installation directory for `include/nlohmann/` and `share/cmake/nlohmann_json/`. Also check for the `pkg-config` file (e.g., `lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc`). You can verify with `pkg-config`:
              ```bash
              # If using a custom prefix, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              pkg-config --modversion nlohmann_json # Should print 3.12.0
              pkg-config --cflags nlohmann_json     # Should print -I/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/include
              ```
      -   **Step 7: Verify Installation with a Sample Project (Optional)**
          *   **Action (CMake):** Create and build the CMake verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE".
              ```bash
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project/build && cd ~/json-verification-project
              # Create main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt with the content from section 2
              cd build
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, point CMake to it
              cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              cmake --build . && ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (CMake):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object.
          *   **Action (Meson):** Create and build the Meson verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE". This demonstrates consumption via `pkg-config`.
              ```bash
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project-meson && cd ~/json-verification-project-meson
              # Create main.cpp and meson.build with the content from section 2
              meson setup builddir
              cd builddir
              meson compile
              ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (Meson):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object. This confirms that the `pkg-config` file generated by the CMake install is working correctly.

      ### **Part B: Advanced CI & Developer Workflows**
      ---
      These tasks are for contributors replicating CI builds.
      -   **Step 8: Contributor Source Code Setup**
          *   **Action:** For development, all work should be based on the `develop` branch.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # The default branch should be 'develop'. Verify this.
              git branch
              # If you are on a different branch (e.g., 'master' or a tag), switch to 'develop'.
              # git checkout develop
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `git branch` command shows `* develop`.
      -   **Step 9: Install Python Dependencies**
          *   **Action:** Create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages for tooling and documentation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              python3 -m venv venv
              source venv/bin/activate
              # Install Python dependencies for documentation and tooling
              pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/astyle/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/generate_natvis/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/serve_header/requirements.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The shell prompt indicates you are in a `(venv)`. Running `pip list` shows packages like `mkdocs==1.6.1`, `astyle==3.4.13`, `jinja2==3.1.6`, `watchdog==6.0.0`, `cppcheck==1.5.0`, `cpplint==2.0.2`, and `reuse==5.0.2` are installed.
      -   **Step 10: Configure for CI Builds**
          *   **Action:** Configure the project using the special `JSON_CI` flag, which enables all CI-specific build targets.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              mkdir build
              cd build
              cmake .. -DJSON_CI=On -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The configuration completes successfully.
      -   **Step 11: Run Static Analysis and Formatting Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build the specific targets for each static analysis and formatting tool.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_astyle
              cmake --build . --target ci_cppcheck
              cmake --build . --target ci_cpplint
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_tidy
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_analyze
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes without errors. If `ci_astyle` fails, it indicates code needs reformatting. If `ci_clang_tidy` fails, it indicates that `clang-tidy` found issues that must be fixed.
      -   **Step 12: Run Packaging, Compliance, and Distribution Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build targets related to packaging and license compliance.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_reuse_compliance
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_amalgamation
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_single_header
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes successfully.
      -   **Step 13: Run CodeQL Static Analysis (Advanced)**
          *   **Action:** Use the CodeQL CLI to create a database from the build, then analyze it.
              ```bash
              # Assumes CodeQL CLI is installed and in PATH
              # Run from the root of the repository, after configuring the build (Step 10)
              # 1. Create the CodeQL database by tracing the build process
              codeql database create --language=cpp --source-root=. \
                --command="cmake --build build --parallel 96" \
                codeql-db
              # 2. Analyze the database using the default C++ query suite
              codeql database analyze codeql-db --format=sarif-latest \
                --output=scan-results.sarif cpp-code-scanning.qls
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete successfully. A `codeql-db` directory and `scan-results.sarif` file are created.
      -   **Step 14: Run Memory Safety Checks**
          *   **Action:** Run Valgrind tests by re-configuring the build.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_Valgrind=ON -G Ninja # Re-configure
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete, and test logs show no memory errors reported by Valgrind.
      -   **Step 15: Test with a Specific C++ Standard**
          *   **Action:** Re-configure the build with the `JSON_TestStandards` variable to test one or more specific standards.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_TestStandards=17 -G Ninja
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build completes successfully, confirming compatibility with C++17.
      -   **Step 16: Build Documentation Locally**
          *   **Action:** After installing Python dependencies (Step 9), build the documentation.
              ```bash
              # Run from the repository root (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json)
              # Ensure the python venv is active
              mkdocs build --config-file docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml --clean
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build` command completes successfully and creates a `site` directory inside `docs/mkdocs/`.
      ---
      ### **Part C: Workspace Cleanup (Optional)**
      ---
      -   **Step 17: Clean Generated Files**
          *   **Action:** To get a clean working directory, you can remove all files and folders ignored by Git.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # WARNING: This will permanently delete all untracked files.
              git clean -fdx
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Running `git status` shows a clean working tree with no untracked files. All build directories and generated artifacts are removed.
NEXT:
  The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the core environment setup (Part A of the plan), including installing system prerequisites, cloning the source code, and then building, testing, installing, and verifying the `nlohmann/json` library with a sample CMake project. It has also installed all necessary Python dependencies for advanced tooling (Part B). The build process failed while setting up the CodeQL CLI, as the download URL for the specified version (v2.18.3) is invalid, causing a 404 Not Found error.
  Update the Dockerfile section for CodeQL installation. You need to replace the broken URL with a valid one for a recent CodeQL bundle and change the extraction command from `unzip` to `tar -xzf` to match the new archive format. For example, use the URL for a newer version like `https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/download/codeql-bundle-v2.18.5/codeql-bundle-linux64.tar.gz`.

--- End of Iteration 1 ---

=== Iteration 2 - [2025-08-29 04:31:14] ===
PLAN:
  Here is the complete environment setup plan, adjusted for your specified hardware and containerized Linux environment.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **C++ Compiler**: A compiler with C++11 support or newer, to be installed via the system's package manager.
          *   Examples: GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.4+.
          *   **Specific C++ Standard Requirements**:
              *   **C++17 Support**: Requires GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   **C++20 Support**: Requires GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Note: The CI system tests an extensive range of versions, including GCC up to 15 and Clang up to 20.
      *   **Build System**: At least one of the following is required.
          *   **CMake**: Version **3.13 or newer**.
              *   Note: The latest version is used in CI and is recommended.
              *   Note: Version 3.28+ is required to enable the optional C++ Modules feature (`NLOHMANN_JSON_BUILD_MODULES`).
          *   **Meson**: Version 0.50 or newer.
          *   **Bazel**: Version 6.0+ is recommended for modern Bzlmod support. `bazelisk` is the recommended installer.
      *   **Build System Generator**: A tool to build the configured project.
          *   Examples: Make, Ninja (recommended for some Makefile targets and as the default for Meson and some CI jobs).
      *   **nlohmann/json Source Code**: The complete source code for the library, version 3.12.0. It will be located in the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      *   **Git (Recommended)**: For cloning the source code repository.
      *   **Standard Unix Tools**: `wget`, `tar`, `unzip`, `locales`. May be required for downloading dependencies or setting up the environment. Usually pre-installed or available via package manager.
      *   **pkg-config**: Required for library discovery by build systems like Meson after installation. The CMake installation process generates the necessary `nlohmann_json.pc` file for this tool.
      *   **Python 3 and pip (Developer)**: Required for various development and tooling scripts. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage Python dependencies.
          *   Used for: Code formatting, documentation generation (`mkdocs`), REUSE compliance, local development server, static analysis tooling, and other helper scripts.
      *   **Docker (Developer, Recommended)**: For replicating the CI environment using containers like `gcc:latest`, `silkeh/clang:dev`, or `ghcr.io/nlohmann/json-ci:*`.
      *   **Recommended IDEs/Editors (Developer)**: While not required, a properly configured editor enhances productivity.
          *   **Visual Studio Code**: With extensions like `ms-vscode.cpptools`, `ms-vscode.cmake-tools`, and `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`.
          *   **CLion**: Natively supports CMake projects.
      *   **Specialized Tools (Optional, for Advanced Testing/Development)**:
          *   **afl-clang++**: For running fuzz tests.
          *   **Valgrind**: For running memory-checking tests. The test execution is controlled by the `JSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake option.
          *   **lcov**: For generating code coverage reports (`ci_test_coverage`).
          *   **Static Analysis & Formatting Tools**: `cppcheck`, `cpplint`, `clang-tidy`, `clang-format`, `iwyu` (Include What You Use), `infer`, **Artistic Style (AStyle)**.
              *   Note: `clang-tidy` is strictly configured via the `.clang-tidy` file in the repository root, where all warnings are treated as errors.
              *   Note: **AStyle** is used for code formatting, configured via the `.astylerc` file. It can be installed as a native executable or as a Python package (`astyle==3.4.13`) as specified in `tools/astyle/requirements.txt` for tooling scripts.
              *   Note: The `cppcheck` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt`.
              *   Note: The `cpplint` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`.
          *   **LLVM Toolchain (Developer)**: Recommended for developers to obtain tools like `clang-tidy` and `clangd`. Can be installed via the system package manager.
          *   **clangd**: A language server for C++ providing code completion, navigation, and diagnostics, often used with VS Code.
          *   **CodeQL CLI**: For running deep static analysis and security scans, replicating the `codeql-analysis.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.
          *   **Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit**: For building with the Intel C++ Compiler (`icpc`).
          *   **Emscripten SDK**: For compiling to WebAssembly.
          *   **github_changelog_generator**: For generating the ChangeLog file.
          *   **pipx**: For running REUSE compliance tools.
      *   **Python Packages**: Various packages specified in `requirements.txt` files within the repository. Key dependencies include:
          *   For documentation (`docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt`):
              *   `mkdocs==1.6.1`
              *   `mkdocs-material==9.6.18`

      ### **Key Generated Files (Post-Installation)**
      ---
      -   **`nlohmann_json.pc`**: This file is generated by CMake during the installation process.
          *   Path: `<install-prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc` (or similar, e.g., `share/pkgconfig/`)
          *   Content Description: A file generated from the `pkg-config.pc.in` template. It allows the `pkg-config` tool to provide compiler flags for locating the library's header files. This is the primary mechanism for build systems like Meson to find the library after it has been installed.
          *   Example Content (after generation):
              ```
              prefix=/usr/local
              includedir=${prefix}/include
              Name: nlohmann_json
              Description: JSON for Modern C++
              Version: 3.12.0
              Cflags: -I${includedir}
              ```
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   The project includes a comprehensive, CI-driven test suite. Contributors should run relevant parts of this suite to verify changes.
      *   **Compiler and C++ Standard Conformance**:
          *   Tests are run against a matrix of GCC (4.8+) and Clang (3.4+) versions.
          *   Tests are run for each C++ standard: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, and C++26. This is controlled via the `JSON_TestStandards` CMake variable (e.g., `-DJSON_TestStandards="17;20"`).
          *   **Specific compiler versions are required for newer standards**:
              *   C++17: GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   C++20: GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Clang tests are run with both `libstdc++` and `libc++`.
      *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
          *   **Memory Safety**: `ci_test_valgrind` runs the test suite under Valgrind. This can be enabled locally with the `-DJSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake flag.
          *   **Address/Undefined Behavior Sanitizers**: `ci_test_clang_sanitizer` builds and runs tests with Clang's sanitizers enabled.
          *   **Fuzz Testing**: `ci_fuzz` builds fuzzer executables (e.g., `parse_cbor_fuzzer`) using `afl-clang++`. Running these generates test inputs in `corpus_*` directories to find parsing vulnerabilities.
          *   **Static Analysis**: A suite of targets run various static analysis tools: `ci_cppcheck`, `ci_cpplint`, `ci_clang_tidy`, `ci_clang_analyze`, `ci_infer`. The `ci_clang_tidy` target is a critical quality gate, as it uses the project's `.clang-tidy` configuration file which treats all reported warnings as build-breaking errors. The `ci_cppcheck` and `ci_cpplint` targets rely on specific Python tooling dependencies specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt` and `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`, respectively.
          *   **Code Formatting Conformance**: A dedicated CI target (`ci_astyle`) runs the Artistic Style formatter to check if the codebase adheres to the style defined in `tools/astyle/.astylerc`. This is a critical quality gate to ensure consistent formatting.
          *   **CodeQL Analysis**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`codeql-analysis.yml`) runs CodeQL to perform deep static analysis and security vulnerability scanning on every push and pull request.
      *   **Build Configuration and Feature Variants**:
          *   **CMake Flags**: `ci_cmake_flags` tests various CMake configuration options. Advanced CI replication can use the `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_COMPILE_OPTIONS` and `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_LINK_OPTIONS` environment variables to inject flags.
          *   **Exception Handling**: `ci_test_noexceptions` verifies that the library compiles and runs correctly with exceptions disabled (using `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and compiler flags like `-fno-exceptions`).
          *   **Implicit Conversions**: `ci_test_noimplicitconversions` tests with implicit conversions disabled.
          *   **Fast Tests**: `JSON_FastTests=ON` can be used to skip expensive tests (e.g., the Unicode tests, which have a 3000-second timeout in CI) and speed up build/test cycles.
          *   **Other Variants**: `test-comparison_legacy` (controlled by `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON=1`), `ci_test_noglobaludls`, `ci_test_diagnostics`, `ci_test_diagnostic_positions` test other specific library features and configurations.
      *   **Packaging and Distribution**:
          *   **Amalgamation**: `ci_test_amalgamation` tests the process of combining all source files into a single header.
          *   **Single-Header Usage**: `ci_test_single_header` verifies the amalgamated single header file can be used correctly.
          *   **Reproducibility**: `ci_reproducible_tests` ensures builds are reproducible.
          *   **License Compliance**: `ci_reuse_compliance` checks for REUSE compliance. This check relies on the Python tooling dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt`.
          *   **SBOM Generation**: A CI step may generate a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format (`nlohmann_json.spdx`).
          *   **`pkg-config` Integration**: The installation process is tested to ensure it correctly generates a `nlohmann_json.pc` file. This is implicitly verified by downstream build tests, such as building a Meson project that depends on the installed library, which relies on `pkg-config` for discovery.
      *   **Specialized Environment Builds**:
          *   **C++20 Modules**: `ci_module_cpp20` tests the experimental C++ Modules support with GCC and Clang.
          *   **Intel Compiler**: `ci_icpc` verifies compilation with the Intel C++ Compiler, using flags like `-diag-disable=2196`.
          *   **Emscripten**: Builds the library using the Emscripten toolchain for WebAssembly.
      *   **Documentation and Developer Tooling**:
          *   **Build Documentation**: `ci_test_build_documentation` ensures the documentation can be built successfully using the Python packages specified in `docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt` and the configuration in `docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`. The final output is generated in `docs/mkdocs/site/`.
          *   **Test Examples**: `ci_test_examples` compiles and runs all example code snippets.
          *   **Local Header Server**: A tool (`tools/serve_header`) is available for local development, which likely serves the single-header file and rebuilds it on changes. Its functionality can be manually verified by running it and observing its behavior.
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      This plan is tailored for a Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based) x86_64 containerized environment, leveraging a high core count for parallel operations. The working directory containing the source code is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      ---
      ### **Part A: Core Environment Setup and Library Installation**
      ---
      -   **Step 1: Install System Prerequisites**
          *   **Action (Debian/Ubuntu):** Install a comprehensive set of tools required for building, testing, and development.
              ```bash
              # Ensure package lists are up-to-date
              apt-get update
              # Install build tools, compilers, and developer utilities
              apt-get install -y build-essential g++ clang cmake git ninja-build python3-pip python3-venv \
                                 valgrind lcov clang-tools cppcheck pkg-config astyle
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Open a new terminal and run `cmake --version` (must be 3.13+), `g++ --version`, `clang --version`, `git --version`, and `pkg-config --version`.
      -   **Step 2: Set Up Source Code Directory**
          *   **Action:** The source code is expected to be present in the working directory. Navigate into it and check out the specific version tag for a stable installation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # For stable installation, check out the specific version tag.
              git checkout v3.12.0
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The current directory is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json` and it contains `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/astyle/.astylerc`, etc.
      -   **Step 3: Configure the Project with CMake**
          *   **Action:** Create a build directory and run CMake to generate the build files. Enable tests for verification.
              ```bash
              mkdir build-cmake
              cd build-cmake
              # -DJSON_BuildTests=ON enables the test suite
              # -DJSON_FastTests=ON can be added to skip slow tests
              cmake .. -DJSON_BuildTests=ON -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build-cmake` directory is populated with project files (e.g., `build.ninja`). No errors are reported.
      -   **Step 4: Build the Project**
          *   **Action:** Compile the project (specifically the tests) using the high core count available.
              ```bash
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build process completes without errors. Test executables are created.
      -   **Step 5: Run the Test Suite**
          *   **Action:** Execute the tests in parallel using CTest.
              ```bash
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The output shows that 100% of tests passed.
      -   **Step 6: Install the Library**
          *   **Action:** Run the install target.
              ```bash
              # To install to a custom local directory (recommended)
              cmake --install . --prefix "/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              # To install to the system default (e.g., /usr/local)
              cmake --install .
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Check the installation directory for `include/nlohmann/` and `share/cmake/nlohmann_json/`. Also check for the `pkg-config` file (e.g., `lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc`). You can verify with `pkg-config`:
              ```bash
              # If using a custom prefix, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              pkg-config --modversion nlohmann_json # Should print 3.12.0
              pkg-config --cflags nlohmann_json     # Should print -I/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/include
              ```
      -   **Step 7: Verify Installation with a Sample Project (Optional)**
          *   **Action (CMake):** Create and build the CMake verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE".
              ```bash
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project/build && cd ~/json-verification-project
              # Create main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt with the content from section 2
              cd build
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, point CMake to it
              cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              cmake --build . && ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (CMake):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object.
          *   **Action (Meson):** Create and build the Meson verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE". This demonstrates consumption via `pkg-config`.
              ```bash
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project-meson && cd ~/json-verification-project-meson
              # Create main.cpp and meson.build with the content from section 2
              meson setup builddir
              cd builddir
              meson compile
              ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (Meson):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object. This confirms that the `pkg-config` file generated by the CMake install is working correctly.
      ---
      ### **Part B: Advanced CI & Developer Workflows**
      ---
      These tasks are for contributors replicating CI builds.
      -   **Step 8: Contributor Source Code Setup**
          *   **Action:** For development, all work should be based on the `develop` branch.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # The default branch should be 'develop'. Verify this.
              git branch
              # If you are on a different branch (e.g., 'master' or a tag), switch to 'develop'.
              # git checkout develop
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `git branch` command shows `* develop`.
      -   **Step 9: Install Python Dependencies**
          *   **Action:** Create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages for tooling and documentation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              python3 -m venv venv
              source venv/bin/activate
              # Install Python dependencies for documentation and tooling
              pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/astyle/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/generate_natvis/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/serve_header/requirements.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The shell prompt indicates you are in a `(venv)`. Running `pip list` shows packages like `mkdocs==1.6.1`, `astyle==3.4.13`, `jinja2==3.1.6`, `watchdog==6.0.0`, `cppcheck==1.5.0`, `cpplint==2.0.2`, and `reuse==5.0.2` are installed.
      -   **Step 10: Configure for CI Builds**
          *   **Action:** Configure the project using the special `JSON_CI` flag, which enables all CI-specific build targets.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              mkdir build
              cd build
              cmake .. -DJSON_CI=On -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The configuration completes successfully.
      -   **Step 11: Run Static Analysis and Formatting Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build the specific targets for each static analysis and formatting tool.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_astyle
              cmake --build . --target ci_cppcheck
              cmake --build . --target ci_cpplint
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_tidy
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_analyze
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes without errors. If `ci_astyle` fails, it indicates code needs reformatting. If `ci_clang_tidy` fails, it indicates that `clang-tidy` found issues that must be fixed.
      -   **Step 12: Run Packaging, Compliance, and Distribution Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build targets related to packaging and license compliance.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_reuse_compliance
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_amalgamation
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_single_header
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes successfully.
      -   **Step 13: Run CodeQL Static Analysis (Advanced)**
          *   **Action:** Use the CodeQL CLI to create a database from the build, then analyze it.
              ```bash
              # Assumes CodeQL CLI is installed and in PATH
              # Run from the root of the repository, after configuring the build (Step 10)
              # 1. Create the CodeQL database by tracing the build process
              codeql database create --language=cpp --source-root=. \
                --command="cmake --build build --parallel 96" \
                codeql-db
              # 2. Analyze the database using the default C++ query suite
              codeql database analyze codeql-db --format=sarif-latest \
                --output=scan-results.sarif cpp-code-scanning.qls
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete successfully. A `codeql-db` directory and `scan-results.sarif` file are created.
      -   **Step 14: Run Memory Safety Checks**
          *   **Action:** Run Valgrind tests by re-configuring the build.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_Valgrind=ON -G Ninja # Re-configure
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete, and test logs show no memory errors reported by Valgrind.
      -   **Step 15: Test with a Specific C++ Standard**
          *   **Action:** Re-configure the build with the `JSON_TestStandards` variable to test one or more specific standards.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_TestStandards=17 -G Ninja
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build completes successfully, confirming compatibility with C++17.
      -   **Step 16: Build Documentation Locally**
          *   **Action:** After installing Python dependencies (Step 9), build the documentation.
              ```bash
              # Run from the repository root (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json)
              # Ensure the python venv is active
              mkdocs build --config-file docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml --clean
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build` command completes successfully and creates a `site` directory inside `docs/mkdocs/`.
      ---
      ### **Part C: Workspace Cleanup (Optional)**
      ---
      -   **Step 17: Clean Generated Files**
          *   **Action:** To get a clean working directory, you can remove all files and folders ignored by Git.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # WARNING: This will permanently delete all untracked files.
              git clean -fdx
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Running `git status` shows a clean working tree with no untracked files. All build directories and generated artifacts are removed.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the majority of the environment setup plan. It correctly installs all system-level dependencies (compilers, build tools), clones the specified version of the nlohmann/json repository, and successfully completes all of Part A: building, testing, installing, and verifying the library with a sample CMake project. It also successfully sets up the Python virtual environment and installs all required Python packages for developer tooling. The build process fails during Part B, specifically at the step responsible for downloading the CodeQL CLI, as indicated by the `wget` command returning exit code 8.
  next step
  The `wget` command for downloading the CodeQL bundle is failing because the URL specified in the plan and Dockerfile is outdated, leading to a "404 Not Found" server error. You need to update the `RUN` command in the Dockerfile to use a valid URL for a more recent CodeQL bundle. Replace the existing `wget` command with one pointing to a newer, correct location. For example, change the target URL from `https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/download/codeql-bundle-v2.18.5/codeql-bundle-linux64.tar.gz` to a valid one like `https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases/download/v2.19.5/codeql-bundle-linux64.tar.gz`.

  #9 6.203 You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
  #9 6.203 changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this

  #9 6.203 
  #9 6.203 If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
  #9 6.203 do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
  #9 6.203 
  #9 6.203   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
  #9 6.203

=== Iteration 3 - [2025-08-29 04:31:54] ===
PLAN:
  Here is the complete environment setup plan, adjusted for your specified hardware and containerized Linux environment.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **C++ Compiler**: A compiler with C++11 support or newer, to be installed via the system's package manager.
          *   Examples: GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.4+.
          *   **Specific C++ Standard Requirements**:
              *   **C++17 Support**: Requires GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   **C++20 Support**: Requires GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Note: The CI system tests an extensive range of versions, including GCC up to 15 and Clang up to 20.
      *   **Build System**: At least one of the following is required.
          *   **CMake**: Version **3.13 or newer**.
              *   Note: The latest version is used in CI and is recommended.
              *   Note: Version 3.28+ is required to enable the optional C++ Modules feature (`NLOHMANN_JSON_BUILD_MODULES`).
          *   **Meson**: Version 0.50 or newer.
          *   **Bazel**: Version 6.0+ is recommended for modern Bzlmod support. `bazelisk` is the recommended installer.
      *   **Build System Generator**: A tool to build the configured project.
          *   Examples: Make, Ninja (recommended for some Makefile targets and as the default for Meson and some CI jobs).
      *   **nlohmann/json Source Code**: The complete source code for the library, version 3.12.0. It will be located in the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      *   **Git (Recommended)**: For cloning the source code repository.
      *   **Standard Unix Tools**: `wget`, `tar`, `unzip`, `locales`. May be required for downloading dependencies or setting up the environment. Usually pre-installed or available via package manager.
      *   **pkg-config**: Required for library discovery by build systems like Meson after installation. The CMake installation process generates the necessary `nlohmann_json.pc` file for this tool.
      *   **Python 3 and pip (Developer)**: Required for various development and tooling scripts. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage Python dependencies.
          *   Used for: Code formatting, documentation generation (`mkdocs`), REUSE compliance, local development server, static analysis tooling, and other helper scripts.
      *   **Docker (Developer, Recommended)**: For replicating the CI environment using containers like `gcc:latest`, `silkeh/clang:dev`, or `ghcr.io/nlohmann/json-ci:*`.
      *   **Recommended IDEs/Editors (Developer)**: While not required, a properly configured editor enhances productivity.
          *   **Visual Studio Code**: With extensions like `ms-vscode.cpptools`, `ms-vscode.cmake-tools`, and `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`.
          *   **CLion**: Natively supports CMake projects.

          *   Path: `<install-prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc` (or similar, e.g., `share/pkgconfig/`)
          *   Content Description: A file generated from the `pkg-config.pc.in` template. It allows the `pkg-config` tool to provide compiler flags for locating the library's header files. This is the primary mechanism for build systems like Meson to find the library after it has been installed.
          *   Example Content (after generation):
              ```
              prefix=/usr/local
              includedir=${prefix}/include
              Name: nlohmann_json
              Description: JSON for Modern C++
              Version: 3.12.0
              Cflags: -I${includedir}
              ```
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   The project includes a comprehensive, CI-driven test suite. Contributors should run relevant parts of this suite to verify changes.
      *   **Compiler and C++ Standard Conformance**:
          *   Tests are run against a matrix of GCC (4.8+) and Clang (3.4+) versions.
          *   Tests are run for each C++ standard: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, and C++26. This is controlled via the `JSON_TestStandards` CMake variable (e.g., `-DJSON_TestStandards="17;20"`).
          *   **Specific compiler versions are required for newer standards**:
              *   C++17: GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   C++20: GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Clang tests are run with both `libstdc++` and `libc++`.
      *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
          *   **Memory Safety**: `ci_test_valgrind` runs the test suite under Valgrind. This can be enabled locally with the `-DJSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake flag.
          *   **Address/Undefined Behavior Sanitizers**: `ci_test_clang_sanitizer` builds and runs tests with Clang's sanitizers enabled.
          *   **Fuzz Testing**: `ci_fuzz` builds fuzzer executables (e.g., `parse_cbor_fuzzer`) using `afl-clang++`. Running these generates test inputs in `corpus_*` directories to find parsing vulnerabilities.
          *   **Static Analysis**: A suite of targets run various static analysis tools: `ci_cppcheck`, `ci_cpplint`, `ci_clang_tidy`, `ci_clang_analyze`, `ci_infer`. The `ci_clang_tidy` target is a critical quality gate, as it uses the project's `.clang-tidy` configuration file which treats all reported warnings as build-breaking errors. The `ci_cppcheck` and `ci_cpplint` targets rely on specific Python tooling dependencies specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt` and `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`, respectively.
          *   **Code Formatting Conformance**: A dedicated CI target (`ci_astyle`) runs the Artistic Style formatter to check if the codebase adheres to the style defined in `tools/astyle/.astylerc`. This is a critical quality gate to ensure consistent formatting.
          *   **CodeQL Analysis**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`codeql-analysis.yml`) runs CodeQL to perform deep static analysis and security vulnerability scanning on every push and pull request.
      *   **Build Configuration and Feature Variants**:
          *   **CMake Flags**: `ci_cmake_flags` tests various CMake configuration options. Advanced CI replication can use the `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_COMPILE_OPTIONS` and `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_LINK_OPTIONS` environment variables to inject flags.
          *   **Exception Handling**: `ci_test_noexceptions` verifies that the library compiles and runs correctly with exceptions disabled (using `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and compiler flags like `-fno-exceptions`).
          *   **Implicit Conversions**: `ci_test_noimplicitconversions` tests with implicit conversions disabled.
          *   **Fast Tests**: `JSON_FastTests=ON` can be used to skip expensive tests (e.g., the Unicode tests, which have a 3000-second timeout in CI) and speed up build/test cycles.
          *   **Other Variants**: `test-comparison_legacy` (controlled by `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON=1`), `ci_test_noglobaludls`, `ci_test_diagnostics`, `ci_test_diagnostic_positions` test other specific library features and configurations.
      *   **Packaging and Distribution**:
          *   **Amalgamation**: `ci_test_amalgamation` tests the process of combining all source files into a single header.
          *   **Single-Header Usage**: `ci_test_single_header` verifies the amalgamated single header file can be used correctly.
          *   **Reproducibility**: `ci_reproducible_tests` ensures builds are reproducible.
          *   **License Compliance**: `ci_reuse_compliance` checks for REUSE compliance. This check relies on the Python tooling dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt`.
          *   **SBOM Generation**: A CI step may generate a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format (`nlohmann_json.spdx`).
          *   **`pkg-config` Integration**: The installation process is tested to ensure it correctly generates a `nlohmann_json.pc` file. This is implicitly verified by downstream build tests, such as building a Meson project that depends on the installed library, which relies on `pkg-config` for discovery.
      *   **Specialized Environment Builds**:
          *   **C++20 Modules**: `ci_module_cpp20` tests the experimental C++ Modules support with GCC and Clang.
          *   **Intel Compiler**: `ci_icpc` verifies compilation with the Intel C++ Compiler, using flags like `-diag-disable=2196`.
          *   **Emscripten**: Builds the library using the Emscripten toolchain for WebAssembly.
      *   **Documentation and Developer Tooling**:
          *   **Build Documentation**: `ci_test_build_documentation` ensures the documentation can be built successfully using the Python packages specified in `docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt` and the configuration in `docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`. The final output is generated in `docs/mkdocs/site/`.
          *   **Test Examples**: `ci_test_examples` compiles and runs all example code snippets.
          *   **Local Header Server**: A tool (`tools/serve_header`) is available for local development, which likely serves the single-header file and rebuilds it on changes. Its functionality can be manually verified by running it and observing its behavior.
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      This plan is tailored for a Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based) x86_64 containerized environment, leveraging a high core count for parallel operations. The working directory containing the source code is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.

              ```bash
              mkdir build-cmake
              cd build-cmake
              # -DJSON_BuildTests=ON enables the test suite
              # -DJSON_FastTests=ON can be added to skip slow tests
              cmake .. -DJSON_BuildTests=ON -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build-cmake` directory is populated with project files (e.g., `build.ninja`). No errors are reported.
      -   **Step 4: Build the Project**
          *   **Action:** Compile the project (specifically the tests) using the high core count available.
              ```bash
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build process completes without errors. Test executables are created.
      -   **Step 5: Run the Test Suite**
          *   **Action:** Execute the tests in parallel using CTest.
              ```bash
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The output shows that 100% of tests passed.
      -   **Step 6: Install the Library**
          *   **Action:** Run the install target.
              ```bash
              # To install to a custom local directory (recommended)
              cmake --install . --prefix "/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              # To install to the system default (e.g., /usr/local)
              cmake --install .
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Check the installation directory for `include/nlohmann/` and `share/cmake/nlohmann_json/`. Also check for the `pkg-config` file (e.g., `lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc`). You can verify with `pkg-config`:
              ```bash
              # If using a custom prefix, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              pkg-config --modversion nlohmann_json # Should print 3.12.0
              pkg-config --cflags nlohmann_json     # Should print -I/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/include
              ```
      -   **Step 7: Verify Installation with a Sample Project (Optional)**
          *   **Action (CMake):** Create and build the CMake verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE".
              ```bash
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project/build && cd ~/json-verification-project
              # Create main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt with the content from section 2
              cd build
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, point CMake to it
              cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              cmake --build . && ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (CMake):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object.
          *   **Action (Meson):** Create and build the Meson verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE". This demonstrates consumption via `pkg-config`.
              ```bash
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project-meson && cd ~/json-verification-project-meson
              # Create main.cpp and meson.build with the content from section 2
              meson setup builddir
              cd builddir
              meson compile
              ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (Meson):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object. This confirms that the `pkg-config` file generated by the CMake install is working correctly.
      ---
      ### **Part B: Advanced CI & Developer Workflows**
      ---
      These tasks are for contributors replicating CI builds.
      -   **Step 8: Contributor Source Code Setup**
          *   **Action:** For development, all work should be based on the `develop` branch.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # The default branch should be 'develop'. Verify this.
              git branch
              # If you are on a different branch (e.g., 'master' or a tag), switch to 'develop'.
              # git checkout develop
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `git branch` command shows `* develop`.
      -   **Step 9: Install Python Dependencies**
          *   **Action:** Create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages for tooling and documentation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              python3 -m venv venv
              source venv/bin/activate
              # Install Python dependencies for documentation and tooling
              pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/astyle/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/generate_natvis/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/serve_header/requirements.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The shell prompt indicates you are in a `(venv)`. Running `pip list` shows packages like `mkdocs==1.6.1`, `astyle==3.4.13`, `jinja2==3.1.6`, `watchdog==6.0.0`, `cppcheck==1.5.0`, `cpplint==2.0.2`, and `reuse==5.0.2` are installed.
      -   **Step 10: Configure for CI Builds**
          *   **Action:** Configure the project using the special `JSON_CI` flag, which enables all CI-specific build targets.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              mkdir build
              cd build
              cmake .. -DJSON_CI=On -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The configuration completes successfully.
      -   **Step 11: Run Static Analysis and Formatting Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build the specific targets for each static analysis and formatting tool.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_astyle
              cmake --build . --target ci_cppcheck
              cmake --build . --target ci_cpplint
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_tidy
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_analyze
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes without errors. If `ci_astyle` fails, it indicates code needs reformatting. If `ci_clang_tidy` fails, it indicates that `clang-tidy` found issues that must be fixed.
      -   **Step 12: Run Packaging, Compliance, and Distribution Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build targets related to packaging and license compliance.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_reuse_compliance
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_amalgamation
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_single_header
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes successfully.
      -   **Step 13: Run CodeQL Static Analysis (Advanced)**
          *   **Action:** Use the CodeQL CLI to create a database from the build, then analyze it.
              ```bash
              # Assumes CodeQL CLI is installed and in PATH
              # Run from the root of the repository, after configuring the build (Step 10)
              # 1. Create the CodeQL database by tracing the build process
              codeql database create --language=cpp --source-root=. \
                --command="cmake --build build --parallel 96" \
                codeql-db
              # 2. Analyze the database using the default C++ query suite
              codeql database analyze codeql-db --format=sarif-latest \
                --output=scan-results.sarif cpp-code-scanning.qls
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete successfully. A `codeql-db` directory and `scan-results.sarif` file are created.
      -   **Step 14: Run Memory Safety Checks**
          *   **Action:** Run Valgrind tests by re-configuring the build.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_Valgrind=ON -G Ninja # Re-configure
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete, and test logs show no memory errors reported by Valgrind.
      -   **Step 15: Test with a Specific C++ Standard**
          *   **Action:** Re-configure the build with the `JSON_TestStandards` variable to test one or more specific standards.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_TestStandards=17 -G Ninja
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build completes successfully, confirming compatibility with C++17.
      -   **Step 16: Build Documentation Locally**
          *   **Action:** After installing Python dependencies (Step 9), build the documentation.
              ```bash
              # Run from the repository root (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json)
              # Ensure the python venv is active
              mkdocs build --config-file docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml --clean
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build` command completes successfully and creates a `site` directory inside `docs/mkdocs/`.
      ---
      ### **Part C: Workspace Cleanup (Optional)**
      ---
      -   **Step 17: Clean Generated Files**
          *   **Action:** To get a clean working directory, you can remove all files and folders ignored by Git.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # WARNING: This will permanently delete all untracked files.
              git clean -fdx
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Running `git status` shows a clean working tree with no untracked files. All build directories and generated artifacts are removed.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully implements the entire core environment setup (Part A of the plan). System prerequisites have been installed, the `nlohmann/json` source code has been cloned, and the library has been successfully built, tested, installed, and verified with a sample CMake project. The process has moved on to Part B, setting up the advanced developer environment. The Python virtual environment has been created and all required Python packages for tooling and documentation have been installed. The build failed at the next step: downloading the CodeQL command-line interface, as the URL specified in the `wget` command is outdated and resulted in an error, consistent with the provided execution log.
  next step
  The immediate next step is to fix the CodeQL installation failure. You need to find a valid, current download URL for the `codeql-bundle-linux64.tar.gz` from the official GitHub repository for CodeQL releases. Once you have the correct URL, update the `RUN wget ...` command in the Dockerfile, replacing the non-working link (`.../releases/download/v2.19.5/...`) with the new one. This will resolve the build error and allow the Docker image creation to complete the remaining setup steps.

--- End of Iteration 3 ---

=== Iteration 4 - [2025-08-29 04:32:35] ===
PLAN:
  Here is the complete environment setup plan, adjusted for your specified hardware and containerized Linux environment.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **C++ Compiler**: A compiler with C++11 support or newer, to be installed via the system's package manager.
          *   Examples: GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.4+.
          *   **Specific C++ Standard Requirements**:
              *   **C++17 Support**: Requires GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   **C++20 Support**: Requires GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Note: The CI system tests an extensive range of versions, including GCC up to 15 and Clang up to 20.
      *   **Build System**: At least one of the following is required.
          *   **CMake**: Version **3.13 or newer**.
              *   Note: The latest version is used in CI and is recommended.
              *   Note: Version 3.28+ is required to enable the optional C++ Modules feature (`NLOHMANN_JSON_BUILD_MODULES`).
          *   **Meson**: Version 0.50 or newer.
          *   **Bazel**: Version 6.0+ is recommended for modern Bzlmod support. `bazelisk` is the recommended installer.
      *   **Build System Generator**: A tool to build the configured project.
          *   Examples: Make, Ninja (recommended for some Makefile targets and as the default for Meson and some CI jobs).
      *   **nlohmann/json Source Code**: The complete source code for the library, version 3.12.0. It will be located in the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      *   **Git (Recommended)**: For cloning the source code repository.
      *   **Standard Unix Tools**: `wget`, `tar`, `unzip`, `locales`. May be required for downloading dependencies or setting up the environment. Usually pre-installed or available via package manager.
      *   **pkg-config**: Required for library discovery by build systems like Meson after installation. The CMake installation process generates the necessary `nlohmann_json.pc` file for this tool.
      *   **Python 3 and pip (Developer)**: Required for various development and tooling scripts. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage Python dependencies.
          *   Used for: Code formatting, documentation generation (`mkdocs`), REUSE compliance, local development server, static analysis tooling, and other helper scripts.
      *   **Docker (Developer, Recommended)**: For replicating the CI environment using containers like `gcc:latest`, `silkeh/clang:dev`, or `ghcr.io/nlohmann/json-ci:*`.
      *   **Recommended IDEs/Editors (Developer)**: While not required, a properly configured editor enhances productivity.
          *   **Visual Studio Code**: With extensions like `ms-vscode.cpptools`, `ms-vscode.cmake-tools`, and `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`.
          *   **CLion**: Natively supports CMake projects.
      *   **Specialized Tools (Optional, for Advanced Testing/Development)**:
          *   **afl-clang++**: For running fuzz tests.
          *   **Valgrind**: For running memory-checking tests. The test execution is controlled by the `JSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake option.
          *   **lcov**: For generating code coverage reports (`ci_test_coverage`).
          *   **Static Analysis & Formatting Tools**: `cppcheck`, `cpplint`, `clang-tidy`, `clang-format`, `iwyu` (Include What You Use), `infer`, **Artistic Style (AStyle)**.
              *   Note: `clang-tidy` is strictly configured via the `.clang-tidy` file in the repository root, where all warnings are treated as errors.
              *   Note: **AStyle** is used for code formatting, configured via the `.astylerc` file. It can be installed as a native executable or as a Python package (`astyle==3.4.13`) as specified in `tools/astyle/requirements.txt` for tooling scripts.
              *   Note: The `cppcheck` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt`.
              *   Note: The `cpplint` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`.
          *   **LLVM Toolchain (Developer)**: Recommended for developers to obtain tools like `clang-tidy` and `clangd`. Can be installed via the system package manager.
          *   **clangd**: A language server for C++ providing code completion, navigation, and diagnostics, often used with VS Code.
          *   **CodeQL CLI**: For running deep static analysis and security scans, replicating the `codeql-analysis.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.
          *   **Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit**: For building with the Intel C++ Compiler (`icpc`).
          *   **Emscripten SDK**: For compiling to WebAssembly.
          *   **github_changelog_generator**: For generating the ChangeLog file.
          *   **pipx**: For running REUSE compliance tools.
      *   **Python Packages**: Various packages specified in `requirements.txt` files within the repository. Key dependencies include:
          *   For documentation (`docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt`):

          *   Path: `<install-prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc` (or similar, e.g., `share/pkgconfig/`)
          *   Content Description: A file generated from the `pkg-config.pc.in` template. It allows the `pkg-config` tool to provide compiler flags for locating the library's header files. This is the primary mechanism for build systems like Meson to find the library after it has been installed.
          *   Example Content (after generation):
              ```
              prefix=/usr/local
              includedir=${prefix}/include
              Name: nlohmann_json
              Description: JSON for Modern C++
              Version: 3.12.0
              Cflags: -I${includedir}
              ```
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   The project includes a comprehensive, CI-driven test suite. Contributors should run relevant parts of this suite to verify changes.
      *   **Compiler and C++ Standard Conformance**:
          *   Tests are run against a matrix of GCC (4.8+) and Clang (3.4+) versions.
          *   Tests are run for each C++ standard: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, and C++26. This is controlled via the `JSON_TestStandards` CMake variable (e.g., `-DJSON_TestStandards="17;20"`).
          *   **Specific compiler versions are required for newer standards**:
              *   C++17: GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   C++20: GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Clang tests are run with both `libstdc++` and `libc++`.
      *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
          *   **Memory Safety**: `ci_test_valgrind` runs the test suite under Valgrind. This can be enabled locally with the `-DJSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake flag.
          *   **Address/Undefined Behavior Sanitizers**: `ci_test_clang_sanitizer` builds and runs tests with Clang's sanitizers enabled.
          *   **Fuzz Testing**: `ci_fuzz` builds fuzzer executables (e.g., `parse_cbor_fuzzer`) using `afl-clang++`. Running these generates test inputs in `corpus_*` directories to find parsing vulnerabilities.
          *   **Static Analysis**: A suite of targets run various static analysis tools: `ci_cppcheck`, `ci_cpplint`, `ci_clang_tidy`, `ci_clang_analyze`, `ci_infer`. The `ci_clang_tidy` target is a critical quality gate, as it uses the project's `.clang-tidy` configuration file which treats all reported warnings as build-breaking errors. The `ci_cppcheck` and `ci_cpplint` targets rely on specific Python tooling dependencies specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt` and `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`, respectively.
          *   **Code Formatting Conformance**: A dedicated CI target (`ci_astyle`) runs the Artistic Style formatter to check if the codebase adheres to the style defined in `tools/astyle/.astylerc`. This is a critical quality gate to ensure consistent formatting.
          *   **CodeQL Analysis**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`codeql-analysis.yml`) runs CodeQL to perform deep static analysis and security vulnerability scanning on every push and pull request.
      *   **Build Configuration and Feature Variants**:
          *   **CMake Flags**: `ci_cmake_flags` tests various CMake configuration options. Advanced CI replication can use the `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_COMPILE_OPTIONS` and `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_LINK_OPTIONS` environment variables to inject flags.
          *   **Exception Handling**: `ci_test_noexceptions` verifies that the library compiles and runs correctly with exceptions disabled (using `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and compiler flags like `-fno-exceptions`).
          *   **Implicit Conversions**: `ci_test_noimplicitconversions` tests with implicit conversions disabled.
          *   **Fast Tests**: `JSON_FastTests=ON` can be used to skip expensive tests (e.g., the Unicode tests, which have a 3000-second timeout in CI) and speed up build/test cycles.
          *   **Other Variants**: `test-comparison_legacy` (controlled by `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON=1`), `ci_test_noglobaludls`, `ci_test_diagnostics`, `ci_test_diagnostic_positions` test other specific library features and configurations.
      *   **Packaging and Distribution**:
          *   **Amalgamation**: `ci_test_amalgamation` tests the process of combining all source files into a single header.
          *   **Single-Header Usage**: `ci_test_single_header` verifies the amalgamated single header file can be used correctly.
          *   **Reproducibility**: `ci_reproducible_tests` ensures builds are reproducible.
          *   **License Compliance**: `ci_reuse_compliance` checks for REUSE compliance. This check relies on the Python tooling dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt`.
          *   **SBOM Generation**: A CI step may generate a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format (`nlohmann_json.spdx`).
          *   **`pkg-config` Integration**: The installation process is tested to ensure it correctly generates a `nlohmann_json.pc` file. This is implicitly verified by downstream build tests, such as building a Meson project that depends on the installed library, which relies on `pkg-config` for discovery.
      *   **Specialized Environment Builds**:
          *   **C++20 Modules**: `ci_module_cpp20` tests the experimental C++ Modules support with GCC and Clang.
          *   **Intel Compiler**: `ci_icpc` verifies compilation with the Intel C++ Compiler, using flags like `-diag-disable=2196`.
          *   **Emscripten**: Builds the library using the Emscripten toolchain for WebAssembly.
      *   **Documentation and Developer Tooling**:
          *   **Build Documentation**: `ci_test_build_documentation` ensures the documentation can be built successfully using the Python packages specified in `docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt` and the configuration in `docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`. The final output is generated in `docs/mkdocs/site/`.
          *   **Test Examples**: `ci_test_examples` compiles and runs all example code snippets.
          *   **Local Header Server**: A tool (`tools/serve_header`) is available for local development, which likely serves the single-header file and rebuilds it on changes. Its functionality can be manually verified by running it and observing its behavior.
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      This plan is tailored for a Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based) x86_64 containerized environment, leveraging a high core count for parallel operations. The working directory containing the source code is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      ---
      ### **Part A: Core Environment Setup and Library Installation**
      ---
      -   **Step 1: Install System Prerequisites**
          *   **Action (Debian/Ubuntu):** Install a comprehensive set of tools required for building, testing, and development.
              ```bash
              # Ensure package lists are up-to-date
              apt-get update
              # Install build tools, compilers, and developer utilities
              apt-get install -y build-essential g++ clang cmake git ninja-build python3-pip python3-venv \
                                 valgrind lcov clang-tools cppcheck pkg-config astyle
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Open a new terminal and run `cmake --version` (must be 3.13+), `g++ --version`, `clang --version`, `git --version`, and `pkg-config --version`.
      -   **Step 2: Set Up Source Code Directory**
          *   **Action:** The source code is expected to be present in the working directory. Navigate into it and check out the specific version tag for a stable installation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # For stable installation, check out the specific version tag.
              git checkout v3.12.0
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The current directory is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json` and it contains `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/astyle/.astylerc`, etc.
      -   **Step 3: Configure the Project with CMake**
          *   **Action:** Create a build directory and run CMake to generate the build files. Enable tests for verification.
              ```bash
              mkdir build-cmake
              cd build-cmake
              # -DJSON_BuildTests=ON enables the test suite
              # -DJSON_FastTests=ON can be added to skip slow tests
              cmake .. -DJSON_BuildTests=ON -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build-cmake` directory is populated with project files (e.g., `build.ninja`). No errors are reported.
      -   **Step 4: Build the Project**
          *   **Action:** Compile the project (specifically the tests) using the high core count available.
              ```bash
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build process completes without errors. Test executables are created.
      -   **Step 5: Run the Test Suite**
          *   **Action:** Execute the tests in parallel using CTest.
              ```bash
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The output shows that 100% of tests passed.
      -   **Step 6: Install the Library**
          *   **Action:** Run the install target.
              ```bash
              # To install to a custom local directory (recommended)
              cmake --install . --prefix "/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              # To install to the system default (e.g., /usr/local)
              cmake --install .
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Check the installation directory for `include/nlohmann/` and `share/cmake/nlohmann_json/`. Also check for the `pkg-config` file (e.g., `lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc`). You can verify with `pkg-config`:
              ```bash
              # If using a custom prefix, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              pkg-config --modversion nlohmann_json # Should print 3.12.0
              pkg-config --cflags nlohmann_json     # Should print -I/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/include
              ```
      -   **Step 7: Verify Installation with a Sample Project (Optional)**
          *   **Action (CMake):** Create and build the CMake verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE".
              ```bash
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project/build && cd ~/json-verification-project
              # Create main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt with the content from section 2
              cd build
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, point CMake to it
              cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              cmake --build . && ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (CMake):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object.
          *   **Action (Meson):** Create and build the Meson verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE". This demonstrates consumption via `pkg-config`.
              ```bash
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project-meson && cd ~/json-verification-project-meson
              # Create main.cpp and meson.build with the content from section 2
              meson setup builddir
              cd builddir
              meson compile
              ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (Meson):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object. This confirms that the `pkg-config` file generated by the CMake install is working correctly.
      ---
      ### **Part B: Advanced CI & Developer Workflows**
      ---
      These tasks are for contributors replicating CI builds.
      -   **Step 8: Contributor Source Code Setup**
          *   **Action:** For development, all work should be based on the `develop` branch.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # The default branch should be 'develop'. Verify this.
              git branch
              # If you are on a different branch (e.g., 'master' or a tag), switch to 'develop'.
              # git checkout develop
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `git branch` command shows `* develop`.
      -   **Step 9: Install Python Dependencies**
          *   **Action:** Create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages for tooling and documentation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              python3 -m venv venv
              source venv/bin/activate
              # Install Python dependencies for documentation and tooling
              pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/astyle/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/generate_natvis/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/serve_header/requirements.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The shell prompt indicates you are in a `(venv)`. Running `pip list` shows packages like `mkdocs==1.6.1`, `astyle==3.4.13`, `jinja2==3.1.6`, `watchdog==6.0.0`, `cppcheck==1.5.0`, `cpplint==2.0.2`, and `reuse==5.0.2` are installed.
      -   **Step 10: Configure for CI Builds**
          *   **Action:** Configure the project using the special `JSON_CI` flag, which enables all CI-specific build targets.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              mkdir build
              cd build
              cmake .. -DJSON_CI=On -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The configuration completes successfully.
      -   **Step 11: Run Static Analysis and Formatting Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build the specific targets for each static analysis and formatting tool.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_astyle
              cmake --build . --target ci_cppcheck
              cmake --build . --target ci_cpplint
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_tidy
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_analyze
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes without errors. If `ci_astyle` fails, it indicates code needs reformatting. If `ci_clang_tidy` fails, it indicates that `clang-tidy` found issues that must be fixed.
      -   **Step 12: Run Packaging, Compliance, and Distribution Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build targets related to packaging and license compliance.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_reuse_compliance
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_amalgamation
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_single_header
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes successfully.
      -   **Step 13: Run CodeQL Static Analysis (Advanced)**
          *   **Action:** Use the CodeQL CLI to create a database from the build, then analyze it.
              ```bash
              # Assumes CodeQL CLI is installed and in PATH
              # Run from the root of the repository, after configuring the build (Step 10)
              # 1. Create the CodeQL database by tracing the build process
              codeql database create --language=cpp --source-root=. \
                --command="cmake --build build --parallel 96" \
                codeql-db
              # 2. Analyze the database using the default C++ query suite
              codeql database analyze codeql-db --format=sarif-latest \
                --output=scan-results.sarif cpp-code-scanning.qls
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete successfully. A `codeql-db` directory and `scan-results.sarif` file are created.
      -   **Step 14: Run Memory Safety Checks**
          *   **Action:** Run Valgrind tests by re-configuring the build.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_Valgrind=ON -G Ninja # Re-configure
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete, and test logs show no memory errors reported by Valgrind.
      -   **Step 15: Test with a Specific C++ Standard**
          *   **Action:** Re-configure the build with the `JSON_TestStandards` variable to test one or more specific standards.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_TestStandards=17 -G Ninja
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build completes successfully, confirming compatibility with C++17.
      -   **Step 16: Build Documentation Locally**
          *   **Action:** After installing Python dependencies (Step 9), build the documentation.
              ```bash
              # Run from the repository root (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json)
              # Ensure the python venv is active
              mkdocs build --config-file docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml --clean
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build` command completes successfully and creates a `site` directory inside `docs/mkdocs/`.
      ---
      ### **Part C: Workspace Cleanup (Optional)**
      ---
      -   **Step 17: Clean Generated Files**
          *   **Action:** To get a clean working directory, you can remove all files and folders ignored by Git.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # WARNING: This will permanently delete all untracked files.
              git clean -fdx
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Running `git status` shows a clean working tree with no untracked files. All build directories and generated artifacts are removed.

  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully automates the core library build, installation, and verification as outlined in Part A of the plan. It correctly installs system prerequisites, clones the source code, builds the project with tests, installs it, and verifies the installation using a sample CMake project. The build process is currently failing during the setup of the advanced developer environment (Part B), specifically at the step to download the CodeQL CLI. The previous execution log shows a `wget` error (exit code 8), indicating the download URL is invalid or inaccessible.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to correct the CodeQL CLI installation. Update the `RUN` command that uses `wget` with a valid and current download URL for the `codeql-bundle-linux64.tar.gz` file from the official GitHub CodeQL release page. The repository and URL structure for these releases have changed.

--- End of Iteration 4 ---

=== Iteration 5 - [2025-08-29 04:35:17] ===
PLAN:
  Here is the complete environment setup plan, adjusted for your specified hardware and containerized Linux environment.
  === ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
      *   **C++ Compiler**: A compiler with C++11 support or newer, to be installed via the system's package manager.
          *   Examples: GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.4+.
          *   **Specific C++ Standard Requirements**:
              *   **C++17 Support**: Requires GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   **C++20 Support**: Requires GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Note: The CI system tests an extensive range of versions, including GCC up to 15 and Clang up to 20.
      *   **Build System**: At least one of the following is required.
          *   **CMake**: Version **3.13 or newer**.
              *   Note: The latest version is used in CI and is recommended.
              *   Note: Version 3.28+ is required to enable the optional C++ Modules feature (`NLOHMANN_JSON_BUILD_MODULES`).
          *   **Meson**: Version 0.50 or newer.
          *   **Bazel**: Version 6.0+ is recommended for modern Bzlmod support. `bazelisk` is the recommended installer.
      *   **Build System Generator**: A tool to build the configured project.
          *   Examples: Make, Ninja (recommended for some Makefile targets and as the default for Meson and some CI jobs).
      *   **nlohmann/json Source Code**: The complete source code for the library, version 3.12.0. It will be located in the working directory `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      *   **Git (Recommended)**: For cloning the source code repository.
      *   **Standard Unix Tools**: `wget`, `tar`, `unzip`, `locales`. May be required for downloading dependencies or setting up the environment. Usually pre-installed or available via package manager.
      *   **pkg-config**: Required for library discovery by build systems like Meson after installation. The CMake installation process generates the necessary `nlohmann_json.pc` file for this tool.
      *   **Python 3 and pip (Developer)**: Required for various development and tooling scripts. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) to manage Python dependencies.
          *   Used for: Code formatting, documentation generation (`mkdocs`), REUSE compliance, local development server, static analysis tooling, and other helper scripts.
      *   **Docker (Developer, Recommended)**: For replicating the CI environment using containers like `gcc:latest`, `silkeh/clang:dev`, or `ghcr.io/nlohmann/json-ci:*`.
      *   **Recommended IDEs/Editors (Developer)**: While not required, a properly configured editor enhances productivity.
          *   **Visual Studio Code**: With extensions like `ms-vscode.cpptools`, `ms-vscode.cmake-tools`, and `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`.
          *   **CLion**: Natively supports CMake projects.
      *   **Specialized Tools (Optional, for Advanced Testing/Development)**:
          *   **afl-clang++**: For running fuzz tests.
          *   **Valgrind**: For running memory-checking tests. The test execution is controlled by the `JSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake option.
          *   **lcov**: For generating code coverage reports (`ci_test_coverage`).
          *   **Static Analysis & Formatting Tools**: `cppcheck`, `cpplint`, `clang-tidy`, `clang-format`, `iwyu` (Include What You Use), `infer`, **Artistic Style (AStyle)**.
              *   Note: `clang-tidy` is strictly configured via the `.clang-tidy` file in the repository root, where all warnings are treated as errors.
              *   Note: **AStyle** is used for code formatting, configured via the `.astylerc` file. It can be installed as a native executable or as a Python package (`astyle==3.4.13`) as specified in `tools/astyle/requirements.txt` for tooling scripts.
              *   Note: The `cppcheck` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt`.
              *   Note: The `cpplint` CI integration relies on a specific Python dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`.
          *   **LLVM Toolchain (Developer)**: Recommended for developers to obtain tools like `clang-tidy` and `clangd`. Can be installed via the system package manager.
          *   **clangd**: A language server for C++ providing code completion, navigation, and diagnostics, often used with VS Code.
          *   **CodeQL CLI**: For running deep static analysis and security scans, replicating the `codeql-analysis.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.
          *   **Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit**: For building with the Intel C++ Compiler (`icpc`).
          *   **Emscripten SDK**: For compiling to WebAssembly.
          *   **github_changelog_generator**: For generating the ChangeLog file.
          *   **pipx**: For running REUSE compliance tools.
      *   **Python Packages**: Various packages specified in `requirements.txt` files within the repository. Key dependencies include:
          *   For documentation (`docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt`):
              *   `mkdocs==1.6.1`
              *   `mkdocs-material==9.6.18`

      ---
      ### **Key Generated Files (Post-Installation)**
      ---
      -   **`nlohmann_json.pc`**: This file is generated by CMake during the installation process.
          *   Path: `<install-prefix>/lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc` (or similar, e.g., `share/pkgconfig/`)
          *   Content Description: A file generated from the `pkg-config.pc.in` template. It allows the `pkg-config` tool to provide compiler flags for locating the library's header files. This is the primary mechanism for build systems like Meson to find the library after it has been installed.
          *   Example Content (after generation):
              ```
              prefix=/usr/local
              includedir=${prefix}/include
              Name: nlohmann_json
              Description: JSON for Modern C++
              Version: 3.12.0
              Cflags: -I${includedir}
              ```
  3.  NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
      *   The project includes a comprehensive, CI-driven test suite. Contributors should run relevant parts of this suite to verify changes.
      *   **Compiler and C++ Standard Conformance**:
          *   Tests are run against a matrix of GCC (4.8+) and Clang (3.4+) versions.
          *   Tests are run for each C++ standard: C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, and C++26. This is controlled via the `JSON_TestStandards` CMake variable (e.g., `-DJSON_TestStandards="17;20"`).
          *   **Specific compiler versions are required for newer standards**:
              *   C++17: GCC 7.0+, Clang 5.0+.
              *   C++20: GCC 9.0+, Clang 9.0+.
          *   Clang tests are run with both `libstdc++` and `libc++`.
      *   **Static and Dynamic Analysis**:
          *   **Memory Safety**: `ci_test_valgrind` runs the test suite under Valgrind. This can be enabled locally with the `-DJSON_Valgrind=ON` CMake flag.
          *   **Address/Undefined Behavior Sanitizers**: `ci_test_clang_sanitizer` builds and runs tests with Clang's sanitizers enabled.
          *   **Fuzz Testing**: `ci_fuzz` builds fuzzer executables (e.g., `parse_cbor_fuzzer`) using `afl-clang++`. Running these generates test inputs in `corpus_*` directories to find parsing vulnerabilities.
          *   **Static Analysis**: A suite of targets run various static analysis tools: `ci_cppcheck`, `ci_cpplint`, `ci_clang_tidy`, `ci_clang_analyze`, `ci_infer`. The `ci_clang_tidy` target is a critical quality gate, as it uses the project's `.clang-tidy` configuration file which treats all reported warnings as build-breaking errors. The `ci_cppcheck` and `ci_cpplint` targets rely on specific Python tooling dependencies specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt` and `cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt`, respectively.
          *   **Code Formatting Conformance**: A dedicated CI target (`ci_astyle`) runs the Artistic Style formatter to check if the codebase adheres to the style defined in `tools/astyle/.astylerc`. This is a critical quality gate to ensure consistent formatting.
          *   **CodeQL Analysis**: A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`codeql-analysis.yml`) runs CodeQL to perform deep static analysis and security vulnerability scanning on every push and pull request.
      *   **Build Configuration and Feature Variants**:
          *   **CMake Flags**: `ci_cmake_flags` tests various CMake configuration options. Advanced CI replication can use the `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_COMPILE_OPTIONS` and `JSON_FORCED_GLOBAL_LINK_OPTIONS` environment variables to inject flags.
          *   **Exception Handling**: `ci_test_noexceptions` verifies that the library compiles and runs correctly with exceptions disabled (using `JSON_NOEXCEPTION` and compiler flags like `-fno-exceptions`).
          *   **Implicit Conversions**: `ci_test_noimplicitconversions` tests with implicit conversions disabled.
          *   **Fast Tests**: `JSON_FastTests=ON` can be used to skip expensive tests (e.g., the Unicode tests, which have a 3000-second timeout in CI) and speed up build/test cycles.
          *   **Other Variants**: `test-comparison_legacy` (controlled by `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON=1`), `ci_test_noglobaludls`, `ci_test_diagnostics`, `ci_test_diagnostic_positions` test other specific library features and configurations.
      *   **Packaging and Distribution**:
          *   **Amalgamation**: `ci_test_amalgamation` tests the process of combining all source files into a single header.
          *   **Single-Header Usage**: `ci_test_single_header` verifies the amalgamated single header file can be used correctly.
          *   **Reproducibility**: `ci_reproducible_tests` ensures builds are reproducible.
          *   **License Compliance**: `ci_reuse_compliance` checks for REUSE compliance. This check relies on the Python tooling dependency specified in `cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt`.
          *   **SBOM Generation**: A CI step may generate a Software Bill of Materials in SPDX format (`nlohmann_json.spdx`).
          *   **`pkg-config` Integration**: The installation process is tested to ensure it correctly generates a `nlohmann_json.pc` file. This is implicitly verified by downstream build tests, such as building a Meson project that depends on the installed library, which relies on `pkg-config` for discovery.
      *   **Specialized Environment Builds**:
          *   **C++20 Modules**: `ci_module_cpp20` tests the experimental C++ Modules support with GCC and Clang.
          *   **Intel Compiler**: `ci_icpc` verifies compilation with the Intel C++ Compiler, using flags like `-diag-disable=2196`.
          *   **Emscripten**: Builds the library using the Emscripten toolchain for WebAssembly.
      *   **Documentation and Developer Tooling**:
          *   **Build Documentation**: `ci_test_build_documentation` ensures the documentation can be built successfully using the Python packages specified in `docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt` and the configuration in `docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`. The final output is generated in `docs/mkdocs/site/`.
          *   **Test Examples**: `ci_test_examples` compiles and runs all example code snippets.
          *   **Local Header Server**: A tool (`tools/serve_header`) is available for local development, which likely serves the single-header file and rebuilds it on changes. Its functionality can be manually verified by running it and observing its behavior.
  4.  COMPLETE TODO LIST:
      This plan is tailored for a Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based) x86_64 containerized environment, leveraging a high core count for parallel operations. The working directory containing the source code is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json`.
      ---
      ### **Part A: Core Environment Setup and Library Installation**
      ---
      -   **Step 1: Install System Prerequisites**
          *   **Action (Debian/Ubuntu):** Install a comprehensive set of tools required for building, testing, and development.
              ```bash
              # Ensure package lists are up-to-date
              apt-get update
              # Install build tools, compilers, and developer utilities
              apt-get install -y build-essential g++ clang cmake git ninja-build python3-pip python3-venv \
                                 valgrind lcov clang-tools cppcheck pkg-config astyle
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Open a new terminal and run `cmake --version` (must be 3.13+), `g++ --version`, `clang --version`, `git --version`, and `pkg-config --version`.
      -   **Step 2: Set Up Source Code Directory**
          *   **Action:** The source code is expected to be present in the working directory. Navigate into it and check out the specific version tag for a stable installation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # For stable installation, check out the specific version tag.
              git checkout v3.12.0
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The current directory is `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json` and it contains `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/astyle/.astylerc`, etc.
      -   **Step 3: Configure the Project with CMake**
          *   **Action:** Create a build directory and run CMake to generate the build files. Enable tests for verification.
              ```bash
              mkdir build-cmake
              cd build-cmake
              # -DJSON_BuildTests=ON enables the test suite
              # -DJSON_FastTests=ON can be added to skip slow tests
              cmake .. -DJSON_BuildTests=ON -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build-cmake` directory is populated with project files (e.g., `build.ninja`). No errors are reported.
      -   **Step 4: Build the Project**
          *   **Action:** Compile the project (specifically the tests) using the high core count available.
              ```bash
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build process completes without errors. Test executables are created.
      -   **Step 5: Run the Test Suite**
          *   **Action:** Execute the tests in parallel using CTest.
              ```bash
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The output shows that 100% of tests passed.
      -   **Step 6: Install the Library**
          *   **Action:** Run the install target.
              ```bash
              # To install to a custom local directory (recommended)
              cmake --install . --prefix "/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              # To install to the system default (e.g., /usr/local)
              cmake --install .
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Check the installation directory for `include/nlohmann/` and `share/cmake/nlohmann_json/`. Also check for the `pkg-config` file (e.g., `lib/pkgconfig/nlohmann_json.pc`). You can verify with `pkg-config`:
              ```bash
              # If using a custom prefix, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              pkg-config --modversion nlohmann_json # Should print 3.12.0
              pkg-config --cflags nlohmann_json     # Should print -I/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/include
              ```
      -   **Step 7: Verify Installation with a Sample Project (Optional)**
          *   **Action (CMake):** Create and build the CMake verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE".
              ```bash
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project/build && cd ~/json-verification-project
              # Create main.cpp and CMakeLists.txt with the content from section 2
              cd build
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, point CMake to it
              cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0"
              cmake --build . && ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (CMake):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object.
          *   **Action (Meson):** Create and build the Meson verification project from "2. FILES TO CREATE". This demonstrates consumption via `pkg-config`.
              ```bash
              # If you installed to a custom prefix in Step 6, set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/nlohmann_json_3.12.0/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
              mkdir -p ~/json-verification-project-meson && cd ~/json-verification-project-meson
              # Create main.cpp and meson.build with the content from section 2
              meson setup builddir
              cd builddir
              meson compile
              ./verify_json
              ```
          *   **Verification (Meson):** The program compiles and runs, printing a formatted JSON object. This confirms that the `pkg-config` file generated by the CMake install is working correctly.
      ---
      ### **Part B: Advanced CI & Developer Workflows**
      ---
      These tasks are for contributors replicating CI builds.
      -   **Step 8: Contributor Source Code Setup**
          *   **Action:** For development, all work should be based on the `develop` branch.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # The default branch should be 'develop'. Verify this.
              git branch
              # If you are on a different branch (e.g., 'master' or a tag), switch to 'develop'.
              # git checkout develop
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `git branch` command shows `* develop`.
      -   **Step 9: Install Python Dependencies**
          *   **Action:** Create a Python virtual environment and install all required packages for tooling and documentation.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              python3 -m venv venv
              source venv/bin/activate
              # Install Python dependencies for documentation and tooling
              pip install -r docs/mkdocs/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/astyle/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/generate_natvis/requirements.txt
              pip install -r tools/serve_header/requirements.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cppcheck.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-cpplint.txt
              pip install -r cmake/requirements/requirements-reuse.txt
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The shell prompt indicates you are in a `(venv)`. Running `pip list` shows packages like `mkdocs==1.6.1`, `astyle==3.4.13`, `jinja2==3.1.6`, `watchdog==6.0.0`, `cppcheck==1.5.0`, `cpplint==2.0.2`, and `reuse==5.0.2` are installed.
      -   **Step 10: Configure for CI Builds**
          *   **Action:** Configure the project using the special `JSON_CI` flag, which enables all CI-specific build targets.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              mkdir build
              cd build
              cmake .. -DJSON_CI=On -G Ninja
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The configuration completes successfully.
      -   **Step 11: Run Static Analysis and Formatting Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build the specific targets for each static analysis and formatting tool.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_astyle
              cmake --build . --target ci_cppcheck
              cmake --build . --target ci_cpplint
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_tidy
              cmake --build . --target ci_clang_analyze
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes without errors. If `ci_astyle` fails, it indicates code needs reformatting. If `ci_clang_tidy` fails, it indicates that `clang-tidy` found issues that must be fixed.
      -   **Step 12: Run Packaging, Compliance, and Distribution Checks**
          *   **Action:** Build targets related to packaging and license compliance.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake --build . --target ci_reuse_compliance
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_amalgamation
              cmake --build . --target ci_test_single_header
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Each build command completes successfully.
      -   **Step 13: Run CodeQL Static Analysis (Advanced)**
          *   **Action:** Use the CodeQL CLI to create a database from the build, then analyze it.
              ```bash
              # Assumes CodeQL CLI is installed and in PATH
              # Run from the root of the repository, after configuring the build (Step 10)
              # 1. Create the CodeQL database by tracing the build process
              codeql database create --language=cpp --source-root=. \
                --command="cmake --build build --parallel 96" \
                codeql-db
              # 2. Analyze the database using the default C++ query suite
              codeql database analyze codeql-db --format=sarif-latest \
                --output=scan-results.sarif cpp-code-scanning.qls
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete successfully. A `codeql-db` directory and `scan-results.sarif` file are created.
      -   **Step 14: Run Memory Safety Checks**
          *   **Action:** Run Valgrind tests by re-configuring the build.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_Valgrind=ON -G Ninja # Re-configure
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The commands complete, and test logs show no memory errors reported by Valgrind.
      -   **Step 15: Test with a Specific C++ Standard**
          *   **Action:** Re-configure the build with the `JSON_TestStandards` variable to test one or more specific standards.
              ```bash
              # Run from the 'build' directory
              cmake .. -DJSON_TestStandards=17 -G Ninja
              cmake --build . --parallel 96
              ctest -j96
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The build completes successfully, confirming compatibility with C++17.
      -   **Step 16: Build Documentation Locally**
          *   **Action:** After installing Python dependencies (Step 9), build the documentation.
              ```bash
              # Run from the repository root (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json)
              # Ensure the python venv is active
              mkdocs build --config-file docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml --clean
              ```
          *   **Verification:** The `build` command completes successfully and creates a `site` directory inside `docs/mkdocs/`.
      ---
      ### **Part C: Workspace Cleanup (Optional)**
      ---
      -   **Step 17: Clean Generated Files**
          *   **Action:** To get a clean working directory, you can remove all files and folders ignored by Git.
              ```bash
              cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/nlohmann_json
              # WARNING: This will permanently delete all untracked files.
              git clean -fdx
              ```
          *   **Verification:** Running `git status` shows a clean working tree with no untracked files. All build directories and generated artifacts are removed.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully completes all of "Part A" of the plan. It installs system prerequisites, clones the source code, and then builds, tests, installs, and verifies the library with a sample project. It also prepares the environment for "Part B" by installing all Python dependencies and the CodeQL CLI, and by configuring a CI-enabled build directory (`build-ci`). However, it does not yet execute the advanced CI checks.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to execute the remaining verification and analysis tasks from "Part B" of the plan. Add `RUN` commands to build the static analysis and formatting targets (Step 11: `ci_astyle`, `ci_clang_tidy`), packaging and compliance targets (Step 12), the documentation (Step 16), and to run the advanced checks like CodeQL analysis (Step 13) and Valgrind memory safety tests (Step 14). This will ensure the environment is not only set up but also fully validated against the project's quality standards.
