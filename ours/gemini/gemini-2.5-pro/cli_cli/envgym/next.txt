current progress
The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the environment setup by installing all specified versions of Go, system packages (git, make, reprepro, gnupg), and required Go tools (golangci-lint, GoReleaser, go-licenses, govulncheck, CodeQL). It has also correctly configured the user, cloned the source repository, and downloaded all Go module dependencies, resulting in a complete development environment as per the plan.

next step
Add a final `RUN` instruction to the Dockerfile to execute key post-setup verification steps from the plan, such as `make test` and `go run script/build.go bin/gh`. This will validate the integrity of the environment and ensure the project can be successfully built and tested within the container, serving as a smoke test during the image build process.
