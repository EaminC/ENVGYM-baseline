Based on the provided hardware information, here is the adjusted environment setup plan. The adjustments focus on Linux compatibility, removing inapplicable OS-specific steps, and clarifying tool requirements for your `linux/amd64` environment.

***

=== ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (ADJUSTED FOR LINUX/AMD64) ===

1.  DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
    This project offers two primary methods for environment setup: an automated approach using Dev Containers (recommended for consistency) and a traditional manual setup.

    **For Automated Setup (Dev Container):**
    -   **Docker Engine:** Required to build and run the development container. For Linux distributions like Ubuntu or Debian, this can be installed by following the official guide for installing `docker-ce`. Download instructions at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
    -   **Visual Studio Code:** The editor required to use the Dev Container functionality. Download from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    -   **VS Code Dev Containers Extension:** The extension that integrates Docker with VS Code. Install from the VS Code Marketplace.

    **For Manual Setup:**
    -   **Go Programming Language:** Version 1.24.6. The `go.mod` file specifies toolchain `go1.24.6` and is the source of truth for the required version. Download the `linux-amd64` tarball from the official Go website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
    -   **Git:** Latest stable version. Required for cloning the source code repository and for the build script to determine the version string. Install via your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git`).
    -   **Make:** A build automation tool required to use the project's `Makefile`. This is typically pre-installed on most Linux distributions.
    -   **Bash:** A Bourne-Again Shell environment is required to run specific integration test scripts and release scripts. This is the default shell on your Linux system.
    -   **GoReleaser:** Version `~1.17.1`. Required for running local release builds that mimic the CI process. Download the `linux_amd64` binary from the [GoReleaser GitHub releases page](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser/releases).
    -   **golangci-lint:** Version `v1.59.1`. Required for running the code linter. Download the `linux-amd64` binary from the [golangci-lint GitHub releases page](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/releases).
    -   **go-licenses:** Required for generating third-party license reports. Install using `go install github.com/google/go-licenses@5348b744d0983d85713295ea08a20cca1654a45e`.
    -   **reprepro:** Optional. Required for managing the APT repository for Debian/Ubuntu distributions as part of the release process. Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install reprepro`).
    -   **GnuPG (GPG):** Optional. Required for signing release artifacts and APT repository metadata. Install via your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install gnupg`).
    -   **CodeQL CLI:** Optional. Required for running local static analysis security scans. Download the `linux64` version from the [CodeQL CLI GitHub releases page](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli/releases).
    -   **direnv:** Optional. A tool to automatically load and unload environment variables. Download from [https://direnv.net/](https://direnv.net/).
    -   **Node.js and npm:** Optional. Required only for developers who need to modify or test the custom GitHub Actions workflows located in the `.github/actions/` directory.
    -   **PowerShell Core (`pwsh`):** Optional. Version 7.0 or newer. This is only required if you intend to test or modify the Windows-specific build scripts from your Linux environment. For general development and building for Linux, this is not needed.

2.  FILES TO CREATE:
    -   **Local Environment Variables File (`.env` or `.envrc`):** Recommended for development in either setup path, especially for running acceptance and integration tests that require authentication or for creating custom builds. Create one of the following files in the project root (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/cli_cli`).
        -   **Option A: `.env` file (manual sourcing)**
            -   **File Path:** Create this file in the project root. You will need to source it manually (`source .env`) before running tests.
            -   **Basic Content Description:**
                ```
                # .env
                # GitHub token with appropriate scopes for running acceptance tests.
                export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
                
                # Optional: For creating custom builds with your own GitHub OAuth app
                # export GH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID="your_oauth_client_id"
                # export GH_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET="your_oauth_client_secret"

                # Other development-specific variables can be added here
                export DEBUG=true
                ```
        -   **Option B: `.envrc` file (for use with `direnv`)**
            -   **File Path:** Create this file in the project root. After installing `direnv` and hooking it into your shell, run `direnv allow` in the directory.
            -   **Basic Content Description:**
                ```sh
                # .envrc
                # Load variables from a .env file (recommended)
                source_env .env
                
                # Or define them directly
                # export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"
                # export DEBUG=true
                ```
