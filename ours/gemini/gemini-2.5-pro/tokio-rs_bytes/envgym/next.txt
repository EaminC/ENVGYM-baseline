current progress
A Dockerfile has been created to automate the setup plan. The initial layer for system dependencies (Plan Step 0) builds successfully. However, the build fails during the subsequent, large `RUN` instruction which attempts to install the Rust toolchain, additional components, targets, and `cargo-hack` (Plan Steps 1 & 2). The rest of the Dockerfile has not been executed due to this failure.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to debug the build failure. Split the single, large `RUN` command that installs the Rust environment into multiple, smaller `RUN` commands. This will isolate the specific failing step, for example, by separating the initial `rustup` installation, the addition of toolchains/components/targets, and the `cargo install cargo-hack` command into distinct layers.
