current progress
The Dockerfile successfully configures a complete development environment by installing Go, Docker CLI, and other system dependencies, cloning the source code, downloading all Go modules, and installing the necessary linters and protocol buffer toolchain. It has completed the setup stages of the plan (Steps 1-4 and 10), providing a workspace ready for development and testing.

next step
Add `RUN` commands to the Dockerfile to execute the core test and verification suite during the image build process. This validates that the environment is correctly configured and the source code is in a healthy state. Specifically, add the build and test commands from Step 5 of the plan:
```dockerfile
# Run static analysis, linting, and style checks
RUN make vet

# Run the standard test suite
RUN make test

# Run the test suite with the race detector
RUN make testrace
```
