current progress
A Dockerfile has been created to automate the environment setup according to the CPU-only plan. It correctly installs system dependencies, a CPU version of PyTorch, and applies necessary configuration changes using `sed`. The build process failed during the dataset download step because the `wget` command uses an incorrect URL (`.../5947321/...`), resulting in a `404 NOT FOUND` error.

next step
In the Dockerfile, correct the dataset download command. Replace the incorrect Zenodo record ID `5947321` with the correct ID `583331` found in the plan, changing the `wget` URL to `https://zenodo.org/records/583331/files/dataset.zip`.
