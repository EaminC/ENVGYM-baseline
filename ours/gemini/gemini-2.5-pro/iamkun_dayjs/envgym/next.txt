current progress
The Dockerfile successfully creates a `linux/amd64` environment based on the specified Node.js LTS version. It installs Git, sets the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, copies all project files, and installs dependencies using `npm ci` as planned. The environment is correctly configured for manual execution of development tasks.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to automate the verification process. Add `RUN` commands to execute the linter (`npm run lint`), unit tests (`npm test`), and the project build (`npm run build && npm run babel`) to confirm that the environment is fully functional and all quality gates pass as defined in the setup plan.
