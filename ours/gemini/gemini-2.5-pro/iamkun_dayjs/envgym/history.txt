=== Iteration 1 - [2025-08-29 01:00:38] ===
PLAN:
  === ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===
  1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
     - **Node.js**: Latest LTS version (`lts/*`) is recommended. This includes npm (Node Package Manager). The `x86_64` build will be used, which is compatible with the specified `linux/amd64` architecture.
     - **Git**: For version control, commit history analysis by `semantic-release`, and to enable pre-commit hook functionality.
     - **Code Editor with EditorConfig Support**: A modern code editor (e.g., VS Code, WebStorm, Sublime Text) with built-in or plugin support for `.editorconfig` to ensure consistent coding styles across different development environments.
     - **GitHub Account**: Required for code hosting, pull requests, and interacting with the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (GitHub Actions).
     - **NPM Account**: Required for publishing packages to the npm registry. You will need an `NPM_TOKEN` for the automated release workflow.
     - **Codecov Account (Optional)**: Required for uploading and tracking code coverage reports. You will need a `CODECOV_TOKEN` to integrate with the CI pipeline.
     - **Sauce Labs Account (Optional)**: Required only for running cross-browser tests using the `npm run test:sauce` script, both locally and in the CI environment. You will need your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key.
     - **Project Dependencies**: All necessary npm packages (e.g., Babel, ESLint, Jest for unit testing, Karma/Jasmine for browser testing, Rollup, TypeScript, `semantic-release` and its plugins, `cross-env`) are listed in `package-lock.json` and will be installed automatically via `npm clean-install` or `npm install`. The lock file ensures exact versions are used for a consistent setup.
  2. FILES TO CREATE:
     - **`.gitignore`**: In the project root, to specify intentionally untracked files for version control.
       - **Content Description**: This file prevents temporary files, local configurations, dependencies, and build artifacts from being committed to version control. It covers OS-specific files, IDE directories, the `node_modules` folder, test coverage reports, and all build outputs like locale files, plugin bundles, ESM modules, and TypeScript declarations.

       /esm
       /index.d.ts
       locale.json
       #dev
       demo.js
       ```
     - **`.npmignore`**: In the project root, to specify files to exclude from the published npm package.
       - **Content Description**: This file ensures the published package is lean and contains only the necessary distribution files. It excludes source code (`src`), tests, development configurations, documentation, and CI/CD files, resulting in a smaller download for end-users.

     - **`.editorconfig`**: In the project root, to enforce consistent coding styles in various editors and IDEs.
       - **Content Description**: This file helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors. It configures universal settings like character set, line endings, and indentation size.
       ```
       root = true
       [*]
       charset = utf-8
       end_of_line = lf
       insert_final_newline = true
       indent_size = 2
       ```
     - **`babel.config.js`**: In the project root, for configuring the Babel transpiler.
       - **Content Description**: This file defines environment-specific configurations for Babel. The `test` environment uses a standard preset for Jest, while the `build` environment uses a preset optimized for Rollup (`modules: false`) to enable tree-shaking and produces smaller, more efficient code (`loose: true`).
       ```javascript
       // babel.config.js
       module.exports = {
         env: {
           test: {
             presets: [
               '@babel/preset-env'
             ]
           },
           build: {
             presets: [
               [
                 '@babel/preset-env',
                 {
                   modules: false,
                   loose: true
                 }
               ]
             ]
           }
         }
       }
       ```
     - **`.eslintrc.json`**: In the project root, for configuring the ESLint linter.
       - **Content Description**: This JSON file specifies the linter configuration, extending `airbnb-base` and adding the Jest plugin. It defines global variables like `window` and `dayjs` to prevent "not defined" errors. It also enforces specific code style rules, such as disallowing semicolons and trailing commas, and relaxes others like `no-param-reassign` for flexibility.
       ```json
       {
         "extends": "airbnb-base",
         "plugins": [
           "jest"
         ],
         "env": {
           "jest/globals": true
         },
         "globals": {
           "window": true,
           "dayjs": true
         },
         "rules": {
           "semi": [
             2,
             "never"
           ],
           "comma-dangle": [
             "error",
             "never"
           ],
           "no-param-reassign": [
             0
           ],
           "func-names": [
             0
           ],
           "import/no-extraneous-dependencies": [
             0
           ],
           "import/no-unresolved": [
             2,
             {
               "ignore": [
                 "dayjs"
               ]
             }
           ],
           "import/extensions": [
             2,
             "never"
           ]
         }
       }
       ```
     - **`prettier.config.js`**: In the project root, for configuring the Prettier code formatter.
       - **Content Description**: This JavaScript file defines code style rules for consistent formatting. It enforces a maximum line width of 80 characters, the use of single quotes, and disables semicolons and trailing commas to align with the ESLint configuration.
       ```javascript
       // prettier.config.js
       module.exports = {
         useTabs: false,
         printWidth: 80,
         singleQuote: true,
         trailingComma: 'none',
         semi: false
       }
       ```
     - **`.releaserc`**: In the project root, for configuring `semantic-release`.
       - **Content Description**: Configures the automated release process. It defines the sequence of plugins for analyzing commits, generating release notes, creating a `CHANGELOG.md`, publishing to npm, and creating a GitHub release. It is explicitly configured to commit the updated `CHANGELOG.md` file back to the repository during a release.
       ```json
       {
         "branches": ["master"],
         "plugins": [
           "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
           "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
           "@semantic-release/changelog",
           "@semantic-release/npm",
           [
             "@semantic-release/git",
             {
               "assets": ["CHANGELOG.md", "package.json", "package-lock.json"]
             }
           ],
           "@semantic-release/github"
         ]
       }
       ```
     - **`jest.config.js`**: In the project root, for configuring the Jest test runner.
       - **Content Description**: This file configures Jest for Node.js-based unit tests. It is set up to collect code coverage information during test runs and specifies the output format (`lcov`) required by Codecov.
       ```javascript
       // Example jest.config.js
       module.exports = {
         collectCoverage: true,
         coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
         coverageReporters: ['lcov', 'text', 'json']
       };
       ```
     - **`tsconfig.json`**: In the project root, for TypeScript configuration.
       - **Content Description**: This file configures the TypeScript compiler, primarily to check JavaScript files (`checkJs`) and to generate a TypeScript declaration file (`index.d.ts`) for consumers of the library. It is set to only emit the declaration file, not to transpile JS.
       ```json
       // Example tsconfig.json
       {
         "compilerOptions": {
           "target": "es5",
           "module": "commonjs",
           "allowJs": true,
           "checkJs": true,
           "strict": true,
           "esModuleInterop": true,
           "declaration": true,
           "emitDeclarationOnly": true,
           "outDir": "./"
         },
         "include": ["src/**/*"],
         "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
       }
       ```
     - **`build/rollup.config.js`**: In the `build` directory, for configuring the Rollup bundler.
       - **Content Description**: This is a dynamic configuration file for Rollup. It is responsible for bundling the source code into multiple formats, including UMD (`dayjs.min.js`) for browsers and ESM (`/esm`) for modern bundlers. It uses Babel for transpilation and Terser for minification, and is designed to handle external dependencies like `dayjs` for plugin and locale builds.
       ```javascript
       const babel = require('rollup-plugin-babel')
       const { terser } = require('rollup-plugin-terser')
       module.exports = (config) => {
         const { input, fileName, name } = config
         return {
           input: {
             input,
             external: [
               'dayjs'
             ],
             plugins: [
               babel({
                 exclude: 'node_modules/**'
               }),
               terser()
             ]
           },
           output: {
             file: fileName,
             format: 'umd',
             name: name || 'dayjs',
             globals: {
               dayjs: 'dayjs'
             },
             compact: true
           }
         }
       }
       ```
     - **`karma.sauce.conf.js` (Optional)**: In the project root, for Sauce Labs integration.
       - **Content Description**: Configures the Karma test runner and Jasmine framework for cross-browser testing on the Sauce Labs platform. It defines multiple batches of browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, Edge, iOS, Android) and selects one via a command-line argument. This test suite runs against a pre-built UMD file (`dayjs.min.js`) and expects test files to follow a `test/*spec.js` pattern.
       ```javascript
       module.exports = function (config) {
         const batches = [
           {
             sl_chrome_26: {
               base: 'SauceLabs',
               browserName: 'chrome',
               version: '26'
             },
             sl_chrome: {
               base: 'SauceLabs',
               browserName: 'chrome'
             },
             sl_firefox_4: {
               base: 'SauceLabs',
               browserName: 'firefox',
               version: '4'
             },
             sl_firefox: {
               base: 'SauceLabs',
               browserName: 'firefox'
             },

     - **`.github/workflows/check.yml`**: In the `.github/workflows` directory, to define the primary CI trigger.
       - **Content Description**: This GitHub Actions workflow acts as an entry point for continuous integration. It triggers on pushes to `master` and `dev`, and on pull requests targeting `dev`. It uses a reusable workflow (`lint-test.yml`) to perform the actual linting and testing jobs and passes necessary secrets.
       ```yaml
       name: Lint & Unit Test
       on:
         push:
           branches: [master, dev]
         pull_request:
           branches: [dev]
       jobs:

           uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-test.yml
           secrets:
             inherit
       ```
     - **`.github/workflows/lint-test.yml`**: In the `.github/workflows` directory, to define the CI job steps.
       - **Content Description**: This is a reusable GitHub Actions workflow that defines the steps for linting and testing the codebase. The `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` directive ensures this workflow executes on a `linux/amd64` environment, consistent with the target hardware. It uses `npm clean-install` for reliable dependency installation, runs linters and Jest-based unit tests, and conditionally uploads code coverage reports.
       ```yaml

       ```
     - **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: In the `.github/workflows` directory, to define the release workflow.
       - **Content Description**: This workflow automates the release process. The `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` directive ensures this workflow executes on a `linux/amd64` environment, consistent with the target hardware. It triggers on pushes to `master`, runs tests, builds the project, and then uses `semantic-release` (run via `npx`) to analyze commits, determine the next version number, publish to npm, and create a GitHub release with a changelog.

  3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
     - **Core API Tests**: Write Jest tests (`*.test.js`) for all public API functions (parsing, formatting, getting/setting units, etc.) to ensure they behave as expected in a Node.js environment on the `linux/amd64` architecture.
     - **Immutability Tests**: For every manipulation method (e.g., `.add()`, `.subtract()`, `.startOf()`), verify that it returns a *new* Day.js instance and does not mutate the original instance.
     - **Timezone Tests**: Create specific tests (under `test/timezone.test.js`) to validate date and time correctness across different timezones (e.g., PST, EST, UTC), especially around daylight saving transitions, using `moment-timezone` for reference.
     - **Plugin Compatibility Tests**: Write tests to ensure plugins can be loaded correctly and that they extend functionality without breaking the core. Verify that plugin builds correctly treat `dayjs` as an external dependency and do not bundle it.
     - **Moment.js Comparison Tests**: Since `moment` is a dev dependency and the project is an alternative, create tests that compare outputs of Day.js methods with their Moment.js equivalents to ensure API compatibility.
     - **Edge Case Tests**: Test handling of invalid dates, leap years, and different date formats to ensure robust parsing and error handling.
     - **ESM Module Compatibility**: Write tests to ensure the ESM build in the `/esm` directory is tree-shakeable and functions correctly when imported in modern JavaScript environments or by bundlers like Webpack or Vite.
     - **TypeScript Type Definition Validation**: Create a separate test setup (e.g., a small TypeScript project in a `test/types` directory) that consumes the generated `index.d.ts` file to verify that types are accurate, exported correctly, and provide proper autocompletion for the public API.
     - **Code Coverage Reporting**: Ensure Jest tests provide adequate coverage of the codebase. The test suite must be configured to generate a coverage report (e.g., in LCOV format) which can be uploaded to services like Codecov to track test quality over time.
     - **Cross-Browser Tests**: Use the Karma, Jasmine, and Sauce Labs setup (`karma.sauce.conf.js`) to run tests (`*.spec.js`) against a matrix of different browsers to ensure compatibility. This includes various versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge, and mobile browsers on iOS and Android.
     - **CI-Readiness Tests**: Ensure all tests are self-contained and can run successfully in a non-interactive, automated environment like GitHub Actions. Avoid tests that rely on local-only resources or user input.
  4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
     - **Step 1: Install Prerequisites & Create Accounts**
       - Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js and Git.
       - Choose and configure a code editor with EditorConfig support.
       - Create a GitHub account for code hosting.
       - Create an NPM account for package publishing.
       - **Verification**: Run `node -v`, `npm -v`, and `git --version` in a terminal to confirm installation.
     - **Step 2: Set Up Project Directory**
       - Create a root directory for your project (e.g., `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/iamkun_dayjs` as specified) and navigate into it. All subsequent paths in this plan are relative to this directory.
       - Initialize a Git repository: `git init`.
       - **Verification**: A hidden `.git` folder is created.
     - **Step 3: Add Project Files**
       - Place `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in the project root.
       - Create `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`, and `.editorconfig` in the project root.
       - Create all other configuration files listed in "FILES TO CREATE", including `.eslintrc.json`, `prettier.config.js`, `jest.config.js`, `.releaserc`, `karma.sauce.conf.js` and the GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`.
       - **Verification**: Check that all files exist in the correct directories.
     - **Step 4: Install Dependencies**
       - In the project root, run `npm clean-install` (or `npm ci`). This is recommended for CI and clean setups as it uses `package-lock.json` strictly. For regular development, `npm install` is also acceptable.
       - **Verification**: A `node_modules` directory is created containing all dependencies.
     - **Step 5: Create Initial Source and Test Structure**
       - Create the directories: `src`, `test`, `docs`.
       - Create placeholder files: `src/index.js`, `test/core.test.js` (for Jest unit tests), and `test/browser.spec.js` (for Karma/Sauce Labs browser tests).
       - **Verification**: The directory structure `src/`, `test/`, `docs/` should exist with placeholder files.
     - **Step 6: Run Linter and Formatter**
       - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run prettier`.
       - **Verification**: The commands execute without errors related to missing tools, confirming ESLint and Prettier are set up. Open a file in your editor to confirm it respects the `.editorconfig` settings (e.g., indentation is 2 spaces).
     - **Step 7: Execute a Unit Test Run**
       - Add a simple test to `test/core.test.js`.
       - Run `npm test`.
       - **Verification**: Jest runs the tests and creates a `coverage/` directory with the test coverage report.
     - **Step 8: Execute a Build**
       - Add ES6 code to `src/index.js`.
       - Ensure the `build` and `babel` scripts exist in `package.json`. If using Node.js v17 or newer locally, you may need to prefix build-related scripts with `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` to maintain compatibility with legacy crypto dependencies used by the build tools. This is already configured in the `release.yml` workflow for CI.
       - Run `npm run build` and `npm run babel`.
       - **Verification**: Check for build artifacts in the root and build directories as specified in `.gitignore`, such as `dayjs.min.js`, `index.d.ts`, and the `esm/`, `plugin/`, and `locale/` directories. The commands should complete without errors. To verify what will be published, run `npm pack --dry-run` and inspect the file list to ensure source code and test files are excluded.
     - **Step 9: Set Up and Verify Git Pre-commit Hook**
       - Stage your changes: `git add .`
       - Attempt a commit: `git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup"`. Note the use of a Conventional Commit message.
       - **Verification**: The `pre-commit` hook triggers `npm run lint`. The commit is aborted if linting fails. Additionally, run `git status` to confirm that ignored files (e.g., `node_modules`, build artifacts) are not staged.
     - **Step 10: Configure Release Automation**
       - In your GitHub repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` and add a new repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN`. The value should be an access token generated from your npm account with "Automation" permissions.
       - Familiarize your team with the **Conventional Commits** specification (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`). The `semantic-release` tool relies on these commit messages to automatically determine version bumps.
       - **Verification**: The secret is saved in GitHub. This will be fully verified when the release workflow runs.
     - **Step 11: (Optional) Configure Codecov for Coverage Reporting**
       - Sign up for Codecov and link your GitHub repository.
       - In GitHub repository secrets, add `CODECOV_TOKEN` with the value from your Codecov repository settings.
       - **Verification**: Verified when the CI pipeline runs and a report appears on Codecov.
     - **Step 12: (Optional) Configure Sauce Labs for Cross-Browser Testing**
       - Set `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` as local environment variables or as GitHub repository secrets for CI runs.
       - Ensure the project has been built first (see Step 8), as this process requires `dayjs.min.js`.
       - Run `npm run test:sauce`. You can pass a batch number, e.g., `npm run test:sauce -- 1` to run the second batch of browsers.
       - **Verification**: Test jobs appear and run in your Sauce Labs dashboard.
     - **Step 13: Push Code and Verify CI/CD Workflows**
       - Create a `dev` branch: `git checkout -b dev`.
       - Commit and push your setup: `git push -u origin dev`.
       - Open a pull request from `dev` to `master` on GitHub.
       - **Verification (PR)**: The "Lint & Unit Test" action triggers on the pull request. The GitHub Actions runner environment (`ubuntu-latest`) is fully compatible with the specified `linux/amd64` hardware. Check the "Actions" tab for a successful run.
       - After merging the PR, push to `master` (if not done automatically).
       - **Verification (Release)**: The push to `master` triggers both the "Lint & Unit Test" and "Release" workflows. Check the "Actions" tab. If successful, verify that a new version tag and release have been created on GitHub, the package has been published to npm, and a commit has been pushed to `master` updating `CHANGELOG.md`. The published package on npm should be lean and not contain development files like the `src` or `test` directories.
NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile successfully creates a `linux/amd64` environment based on the specified Node.js LTS version. It installs Git, sets the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, copies all project files, and installs dependencies using `npm ci` as planned. The environment is correctly configured for manual execution of development tasks.
  next step
  Modify the Dockerfile to automate the verification process. Add `RUN` commands to execute the linter (`npm run lint`), unit tests (`npm test`), and the project build (`npm run build && npm run babel`) to confirm that the environment is fully functional and all quality gates pass as defined in the setup plan.
