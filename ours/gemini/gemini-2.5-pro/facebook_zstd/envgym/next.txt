current progress
The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the first three steps of the plan: all specified prerequisites have been installed, the source code has been copied into the image, and the project has been successfully compiled using `make all`. The build process is complete, but the validation and installation steps are currently commented out.

next step
Uncomment the line `RUN make -j$(nproc) check` to execute the primary test suite and validate the build artifacts, as specified in Step 4 of the plan. After tests pass, uncomment `RUN make install` and `RUN ldconfig` to complete the installation phase (Step 5).
