current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the core setup, build, and installation stages from the plan. It correctly installs system prerequisites and the Rust toolchain, clones the source code, and executes quality checks, tests, the final build, and the `make install` command. However, the current Docker layer caching strategy for dependencies is inefficient because it builds the entire project before caching, and key verification steps outlined in the plan are missing from the build process itself.

next step
1.  Optimize Docker layer caching: Modify the Dockerfile to copy only `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` first, then run a build command on a dummy source file to cache only the dependencies. After that, copy the full source code for the main build steps.
2.  Add build verification: After the `RUN cargo build --release --locked` step, add a new `RUN ./target/release/fd --version` command to validate that the compiled binary is executable before installation.
3.  Implement final verification: Change the final `CMD` from `["/bin/bash"]` to `["fd", "README.md"]` to make the container automatically run the final verification task from the plan upon execution.
