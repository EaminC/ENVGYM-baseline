current progress
The Dockerfile successfully implements the multi-stage build process outlined in the plan. It correctly separates build-time dependencies into a `builder` stage and runtime dependencies into a minimal `debian:12-slim` final stage. The build process has been optimized by using the `--features=build-assets` flag during compilation, which correctly replaces the `assets/create.sh` script mentioned in the plan. The paths for copying the compiled binary, man page, and shell completion scripts have been correctly adjusted to reflect this optimized build output. Furthermore, the Dockerfile has successfully implemented the optional configuration steps, creating both a system-wide configuration file at `/etc/bat/config` and a shell profile script at `/etc/profile.d/bat.sh` to set defaults and aliases. The environment setup is complete and robust.

next step
Since the environment setup and build process are now complete and aligned with the plan, the next step is to integrate the project's test suite into the Docker build to ensure the application's correctness. Before the final release build command (`RUN cargo build --release ...`), add a step in the builder stage to execute the full test suite as specified in the plan's "Developer Contribution Tests" section. This will validate the code and prevent a broken build from being packaged into the final image. The command to add is `RUN cargo test --locked --all-features`.
