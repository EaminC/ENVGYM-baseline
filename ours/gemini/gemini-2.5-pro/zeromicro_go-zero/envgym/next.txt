current progress
A comprehensive Dockerfile for a Go development environment has been created, successfully setting up the base image, environment variables, and installing system-level dependencies like `git`, `make`, and `protobuf-compiler`. The build process is failing during the installation of Go-based development tools (`protoc-gen-go`) via `go install`. The failure is likely caused by installing these global tools after the project's `go.mod` file has been copied, which can create dependency conflicts.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to ensure the global Go tools are installed independently of the project's modules. Move the `RUN go install ...` commands to execute *before* the `COPY go.mod go.sum ./` instruction. Additionally, combine all `go install` commands into a single `RUN` layer using `&&` to improve build efficiency and atomicity.
