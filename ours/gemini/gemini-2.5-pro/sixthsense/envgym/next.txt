current progress
A functional `Dockerfile` has been created that successfully sets up the Python environment and copies both source code and pre-downloaded datasets into the image. This deviates from the plan, which specified downloading datasets directly via `wget`. The current image is configured to start an interactive shell (`/bin/bash`) by default, rather than executing the training script as planned.

next step
Modify the `Dockerfile` to align with the original plan. First, add the `RUN` command to install `wget` system dependency. Second, replace the `COPY csvs/ ./csvs/` line with the planned `RUN wget ...` commands to download the datasets directly during the image build, making the image self-contained. Finally, change `CMD ["/bin/bash"]` to `ENTRYPOINT ["python", "train.py"]` to set the default container command to run the training script.
