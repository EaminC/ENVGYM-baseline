current progress: The Dockerfile has been successfully configured to set up the environment by installing system dependencies, creating necessary directories and configuration files, installing CPU-only PyTorch and required packages, and setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable. The Docker build and runtime execution have succeeded.

next step: Add the command `RUN python environment_validation.py` after setting the environment variable and before the CMD to validate the environment during the build process.
