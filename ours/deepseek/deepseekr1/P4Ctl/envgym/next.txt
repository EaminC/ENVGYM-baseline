current progress: The Dockerfile includes all necessary dependencies and steps for the environment setup, but the build failed because the SDE tarball (bf-sde-9.7.0.tgz) was missing and SDE_URL argument was not provided during build.

next step: Modify the Dockerfile to include a default public SDE_URL as fallback in the ARG instruction and enhance error messaging for missing dependencies. Specifically:  
1. Add a default value to ARG SDE_URL (e.g. ARG SDE_URL="")  
2. Update the error message to explicitly state: "Provide SDE_URL via --build-arg or place bf-sde-9.7.0.tgz in Docker build context root"  
3. Add verification step for SDE directory structure post-extraction
