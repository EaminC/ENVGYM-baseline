current progress: Dockerfile successfully builds and runs, setting up the Go environment and project structure with dependencies downloaded. The image uses bash as the default command.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to build the project binary and update CMD to start the server. Specifically: add `RUN go build -o greet .` after `RUN go mod download`, and replace `CMD ["/bin/bash"]` with `CMD ["./greet", "-f", "etc/greet-api.yaml"]`.
