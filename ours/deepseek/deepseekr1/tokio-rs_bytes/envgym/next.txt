current progress: The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the initial environment setup including: system dependency installation, Rust toolchain setup (rustup, specific nightly version, targets), conditional project file creation (Cargo.toml, main.rs), cargo-hack installation, standard build execution, and storage cleanup. Cross-compilation toolchains are installed, and the project is built for the native x86_64 architecture.

next step: Add all testing stages from the plan: 1) Create no_std test file 2) Append loom configuration to Cargo.toml 3) Run all test commands (steps 8-12, 15-22) including cross-platform builds, feature testing, documentation generation, and CI simulation. Move final cleanup to after test execution.
