current progress: The Dockerfile has successfully implemented all environment setup steps including system dependencies, repository cloning, requirements modification, directory verification, virtual environment creation, dependency installation, and dry-run verifications. All tests from the plan up to the dry-run stage have passed, confirming Python package functionality, dataset integrity, and script readiness.

next step: Add RUN commands to the Dockerfile for executing actual experiments (without --dry-run) and verifying CSV output generation in all specified directories as per the plan's final validation steps.
