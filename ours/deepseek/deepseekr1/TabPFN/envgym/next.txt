current progress: The Dockerfile has been successfully built and executed, incorporating the optimized base image, combined RUN commands, and environment variables. However, it includes an unnecessary COPY command and uses an incorrect CMD instruction.

next step: Remove the 'COPY . .' line and update CMD to '["python"]' to align with the optimized plan.
