```dockerfile

Key adjustments made:
1. Changed base image from CUDA-dependent `nvidia/cuda:10.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04` to non-GPU `ubuntu:20.04`
2. Added `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` for non-interactive package installation
3. Removed all GPU-specific components while maintaining Python 3.8 compatibility
4. Verified Ubuntu 20.04 has native support for x86_64 architecture
5. Preserved working directory structure and build optimizations
6. Maintained Python 3.8 installation through Ubuntu's official repositories
7. Removed CUDA-specific dependencies while keeping core functionality

The adjusted plan:
- Uses a CPU-only environment
- Maintains Python 3.8 compatibility
- Matches x86_64 architecture requirements
- Avoids GPU dependencies as specified
- Preserves BuildKit compatibility
- Keeps working directory structure intact
