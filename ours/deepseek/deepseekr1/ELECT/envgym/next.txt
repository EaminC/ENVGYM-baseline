current progress: The Dockerfile has been adjusted to set WORKDIR before copying requirements.txt and installing dependencies, but the build failed because requirements.txt was not found in the build context during the COPY operation.

next step: Ensure requirements.txt exists in the build context and adjust the COPY command path if necessary, then revert CMD to execute main.py as originally planned.
