current progress: Dockerfile successfully sets up the environment including all dependencies (Docker, Go, Kind, kubectl, Helm), Python virtual environment, project installation, pre-commit hooks, library compilation, and directory creation. Docker execution log confirms successful build and runtime.

next step: Add test execution commands to Dockerfile to automatically run critical validation tests (Kubernetes cluster setup, operator deployment, and bug reproduction tests) during image build
