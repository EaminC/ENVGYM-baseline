current progress
The Dockerfile has been successfully built and executed, implementing the adjusted environment setup plan. Key completed steps include: system dependency installation, repository cloning with submodules to the specified path (`/home/cc/EnvGym/data/Baleen`), Python requirements installation, BCacheSim compilation via CMake and Make, trace file downloads via `get-tectonic.sh`, and environment variable configuration. The jupyter.service setup (step 6) was intentionally omitted as it is not applicable to Docker environments.

next step
No modifications required to the Dockerfile. Proceed with running the container to execute manual verifications and test cases per the plan.
