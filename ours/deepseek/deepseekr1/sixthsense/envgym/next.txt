current progress
Dockerfile configuration has been updated to use archived Debian repositories for apt dependencies, created required directories, and implemented cache optimizations. The dataset download step failed due to a 404 error when accessing the Zenodo URL.

next step
Modify the dataset download URL in the Dockerfile to use a stable Zenodo API endpoint: `https://zenodo.org/api/records/6388301/files/sixthsense-dataset-v2.0.zip/content`
