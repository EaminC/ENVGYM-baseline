current progress: The Dockerfile successfully implements a multi-stage build with PNPM support, dependency caching, and build optimizations. The builder stage correctly installs PNPM, handles monorepo dependencies with frozen lockfiles, and builds the project with increased memory allocation. The build and runtime stages show success logs, confirming basic functionality.

next step: Modify the final stage to use nginx:1.25.5-alpine instead of Node.js, copy only the dist artifacts from the builder stage to /usr/share/nginx/html, add the nginx.conf copy command, and implement production runtime configuration (EXPOSE 80 + CMD). Remove unnecessary steps like bash installation and full app copy.
