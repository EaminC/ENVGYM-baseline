current progress: Dockerfile uses the correct base image (eclipse-temurin:17-jdk), sets up the workspace, and includes necessary package installations. It manually configures Android SDK, generates local.properties, sets Gradle parallel build properties, and successfully builds the project. However, it does not implement the multi-stage structure, Dockerized Android emulator, or hardware optimizations specified in the adjusted plan.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to implement multi-stage build with builder, android, and tester stages; replace manual Android SDK setup with redroid emulator; remove wget and SDK installation steps; add adb connection and permission tests while retaining Gradle property optimizations.
