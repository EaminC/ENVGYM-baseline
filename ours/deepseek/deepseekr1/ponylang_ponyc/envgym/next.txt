current progress: Build failed during the first RUN command at the LLVM installation step due to missing dependencies, specifically lsb-release required by llvm.sh. The Dockerfile includes all planned optimizations but encounters a runtime dependency issue.

next step: Add 'lsb-release' to the apt-get install list in the first RUN command to satisfy llvm.sh requirements before proceeding.
