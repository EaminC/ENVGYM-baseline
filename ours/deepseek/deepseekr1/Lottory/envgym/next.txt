current progress
The Dockerfile has been successfully built and executed. It includes Python 3.7, creates a virtual environment, installs all required CPU-only packages (PyTorch 1.2.0+cpu, torchvision 0.4.0+cpu, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, scipy, tqdm, Pillow, and dependencies), and verifies correct installations through version checks and import tests. CUDA availability is confirmed as False, aligning with the CPU-only requirement.

next step
Add the repository clone step and smoke test execution to Dockerfile. Modify CMD to run the smoke test automatically: include `git clone` before copying files, and replace CMD with test command `python main.py --prune_iterations=3 --end_iter=5`.
