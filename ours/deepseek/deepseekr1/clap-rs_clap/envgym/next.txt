current progress
The Dockerfile has been updated with optimizations including combined apt commands, noninteractive environment, and cleanup steps. However, the build failed due to the base image `rust:1.73.0-focal` not being found on Docker Hub.

next step
Change the base image to `rust:1.73.0` (Debian-based) or `rust:1.73.0-slim-bullseye`, then verify compatibility with Python 3.8 installation steps and required dependencies.
