current progress: Base environment configured with Rust, build tools, and dependencies installed; fd cloned, built, and globally installed; test environment, ignore config, and Cross.toml created; zsh autocompletion file copied. Missing ripgrep dependency, bash/fish completions, and all verification/testing steps.

next step: Add ripgrep installation, generate all shell completions via `make completions`, implement verification steps (version/path checks, Cargo.lock validation), run test suites (functional, cross-compilation, formatting, linting, MSRV), execute benchmarks, create Debian package, and clean artifacts.
