current progress
The Dockerfile setup has progressed through base dependency installation and Python package setup. Repository cloning for Metis, RefFS, IOCov, fsl-spin, and swarm-mcfs completed successfully, but failed at explode-0.1pre cloning despite retry logic. No component builds have started yet due to the clone failure.

next step
Modify Dockerfile to:
1. Increase explode clone retries to 10 attempts
2. Add wget fallback for manual explode download
3. Add repository validation checks after each clone
4. Combine all cloning into a single robust RUN command
5. Add network diagnostics before clone attempts
