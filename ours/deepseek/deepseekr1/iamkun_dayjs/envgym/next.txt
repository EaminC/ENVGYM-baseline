current progress: The Dockerfile has been modified to include multi-stage builds with separate builder, development, and production stages. Key improvements include splitting RUN commands for better error isolation, adding OpenSSL legacy provider workarounds, implementing conditional Sauce Labs test execution, and enhanced logging. The build and runtime tests have executed successfully.

next step: Optimize the production stage by copying only the essential artifact (dayjs.min.js) instead of the entire build directory, and remove the development stage unless explicitly required for debugging. Update the artifact copy path to match the plan's /dist location for minimal image size.
