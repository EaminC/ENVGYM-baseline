current progress: Build stage failed at `pnpm build` with exit code 1, and runtime stage is configured for interactive bash instead of production execution.

next step: Update Dockerfile to match adjusted plan: add `--prod` flag to build stage install, replace interactive runtime with optimized production stage (remove bash, copy only package.json/build/node_modules, set non-root user, and change CMD to `node build` or `node build/index.js`).
