current progress: Dockerfile partially implements adjusted plan with Go 1.25 base, protobuf-compiler installation, dependency restoration, and parallel builds using -p=${PARALLELISM}. Missing parallelism in vendor operations, verbosity in verify step, protoc-gen-go-grpc build, and protobuf generation.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to add -parallel=${PARALLELISM} to all go mod vendor commands, include -v in gcp/observability verify step, build protoc-gen-go-grpc with -p=${PARALLELISM}, and add protobuf generation step using protoc command with correct proto path.
