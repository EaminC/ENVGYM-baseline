current progress
The Dockerfile has successfully implemented the initial steps: dependency installation (step 1), repository cloning (step 2), primary build (step 3), short tests (step 4), extended tests (step 5), and installation (step 9). A non-root user was created for test execution. The Docker build and runtime completed successfully, confirming basic functionality.

next step
Add static analysis (step 6) after switching back to root post-extended tests and before installation. Insert post-build verification (step 8: `./zstd -V` and `./zstd -12 README.md -o test.zst && ls test.zst`) after the primary build and before short tests.
