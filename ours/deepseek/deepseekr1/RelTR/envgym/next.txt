current progress: Docker build failed during Miniconda installation step. The wget command for Miniconda download returned exit code 8 (server error), indicating potential URL issues or network problems. All steps before this (system package installation) completed successfully.

next step: Modify the Miniconda installation URL in Dockerfile to use working archive mirror: https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py36_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh instead of the archive path
