current progress
Dockerfile setup completed with Ubuntu 20.04 base, required package installations, and build configuration. The Docker build failed due to a 5-minute timeout during the CMake/Ninja compilation step. The validation script (/validate.sh) is properly configured for post-build tests including Valgrind checks.

next step
Reduce build parallelism in Dockerfile to prevent timeout by modifying `ninja -j $(nproc)` to use 2 jobs instead of all cores. Add explicit JSON sample downloads to COPY command before build.
