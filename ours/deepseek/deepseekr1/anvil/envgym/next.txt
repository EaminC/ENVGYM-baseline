current progress
The Docker build failed at the Z3 installation step. The error occurred during the Z3 compilation process (`make -j2 VERBOSE=1` exited with code 1), indicating a failure in building Z3 v4.12.2. All previous steps including system dependency installation, Rust setup, and environment configuration completed successfully. The Dockerfile structure and path configurations are correctly implemented per the adjusted plan.

next step
Modify the Z3 build step in the Dockerfile to use `$(nproc)` for parallelism instead of fixed `-j2`, and add explicit Python package installations before building Z3:
```dockerfile
RUN set -x && \
    pip install pyparsing && \
    git clone https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 && \
    cd z3 && \
    git checkout z3-4.12.2 && \
    python scripts/mk_make.py --parallel=$(nproc) && \
    cd build && \
    make -j$(nproc) VERBOSE=1 && \
    make install
```
