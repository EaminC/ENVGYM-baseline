current progress
The Docker build failed at the `cargo test --workspace` step with exit code 101 during the test execution phase. The build process successfully completed the Rust tooling installation, dependency installation, and initial workspace build, but encountered a failure when running the standard test suite.

next step
Modify the failing test command in Dockerfile to `RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture` to capture detailed failure logs and backtraces.
