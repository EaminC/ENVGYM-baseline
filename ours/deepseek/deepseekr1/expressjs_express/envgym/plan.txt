Here's the adjusted environment configuration plan based on the hardware specifications:

```plaintext
=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED: 
   [Same as original plan - compatible with x86_64 architecture]

2. FILES TO CREATE: 
   [Same as original plan - Linux compatible]

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES: 
   [Same as original plan]

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTED): 
   [ADDED PRE-STEP FOR ALL OPTIONS]
   0. Navigate to working directory: cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/expressjs_express

   [Option A: Minimal Express App]
   1-21. [Same as original]
   [FIXED TYPO IN STEP 13]: 
        Path: ./coverage/lcov.info (removed erroneous character)
   [FIXED TYPO IN STEP 11]: 
        Dependabot config: " - package-ecosystem:..." (removed Chinese character)

   [Option B: express-generator Setup]
   [Same as Option A adjustments]

   [Option C: Contribution Setup]
   1. Install Git: apt-get update && apt-get install -y git (verify: git --version)
   2. Install Node.js v18+ (verify: node --version)
   3. Install wrk and make: apt-get update && apt-get install -y wrk make (verify: wrk --version && make --version)
   4. Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1 (verify: express directory exists)
   5-30. [Same as original with these adjustments]:
        - Removed sudo from apt-get commands
        - Added make installation for benchmarks
        - All paths relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/expressjs_express/express
```

**Key Adjustments Rationale:**

1. **Path Corrections:**
   - Added explicit working directory navigation (`cd /home/cc/EnvGym/data/expressjs_express`)
   - All file operations now relative to specified working directory
   - Fixed erroneous path in CI workflow (`./coverage/lcov.info`)

2. **Package Installation:**
   - Removed `sudo` from `apt-get` commands (container environment)
   - Combined package installations with `apt-get update` for reliability
   - Added `make` installation (required for benchmarks)
   - Simplified wrk installation (native package vs source build)

3. **Architecture Compatibility:**
   - All downloads and binaries compatible with x86_64/linux-amd64
   - Node.js v18+ verified compatible with Debian-based containers
   - Docker BuildKit support maintained through standard instructions

4. **Content Fixes:**
   - Fixed encoding issues in generated YAML files
   - Corrected dependabot configuration syntax
   - Removed redundant package-lock handling (already in .gitignore)

5. **Container Optimization:**
   - Combined package operations to minimize layers
   - Removed unnecessary GPU-related considerations
   - Verified base image (node:lts) includes Python for native modules

The plan maintains all original functionality while ensuring compatibility with the specified Linux/x86_64 environment and Docker workflow constraints. All verification steps remain operational in the container environment.
