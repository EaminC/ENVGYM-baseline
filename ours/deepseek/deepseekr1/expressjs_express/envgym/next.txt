current progress: Dockerfile successfully builds and runs, installing system dependencies (git, wrk, make), setting up non-root user, cloning Express repository, installing npm dependencies, and verifying environment. Bootstrap and test steps remain commented out due to previous failures.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to uncomment and execute `npm run bootstrap` and `npm test` commands after dependency installation, ensuring proper project setup and validation.
