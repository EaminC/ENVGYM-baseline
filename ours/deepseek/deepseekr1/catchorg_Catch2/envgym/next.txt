current progress
The Docker build and runtime stages completed successfully. The build stage correctly compiles the project in Release mode with parallel optimization. However, the runtime stage contains unnecessary elements: it copies the entire source code instead of only built binaries and sets an extraneous WORKDIR.

next step
Modify the runtime stage to: remove WORKDIR, replace "COPY . ." with "COPY --from=builder /app/build/bin /usr/local/bin", and ensure no source code remains in the final image.
