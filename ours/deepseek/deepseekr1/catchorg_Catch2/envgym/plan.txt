Based on the hardware information and project requirements, here's the adjusted Dockerfile plan:

```dockerfile
# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.4

FROM ubuntu:20.04 as builder

ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mkdir build && cd build && \
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && \
    cmake --build . --parallel $(nproc)

FROM ubuntu:20.04 as runtime
COPY --from=builder /app/build/bin /usr/local/bin

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

Key adjustments:
1. Removed redundant `--config Release` flag (not needed for Makefile generators)
2. Verified x86_64 compatibility through Ubuntu 20.04 base image
3. Maintained multi-stage build to minimize final image size
4. Kept build parallelism via `--parallel $(nproc)`
5. Confirmed path consistency with project location
6. Ensured non-CUDA image usage per hardware constraints
7. Preserved BuildKit syntax compatibility for Docker 28.1.1

The plan now:
- Uses appropriate x86_64 base image
- Avoids GPU-specific components
- Maintains correct working directory paths
- Optimizes build performance through parallel compilation
- Keeps minimal runtime dependencies
- Ensures compatibility with Docker version 28.1.1 features
- Respects project's C++ nature through build tooling
