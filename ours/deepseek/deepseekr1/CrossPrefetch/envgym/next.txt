current progress
Docker build failed due to missing requirements.txt during builder stage COPY operation. The Dockerfile structure maintains the optimized multi-stage design with BuildKit caching, virtual environment setup, and CPU-only configuration. Runtime stage correctly copies application files but fails due to build error.

next step
Modify the COPY command in the builder stage to use absolute path: COPY /path/to/requirements.txt . (replace with actual path) or verify requirements.txt exists in build context root.
