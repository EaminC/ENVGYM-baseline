current progress: Dockerfile implements multi-stage build with parallelization adjustments and build-time optimizations including HUSKY=0 and --ignore-scripts. Build and runtime stages execute successfully.

next step: Modify production stage to copy only dist, package.json, and node_modules instead of entire app directory, and change CMD to ["npm", "start"]
