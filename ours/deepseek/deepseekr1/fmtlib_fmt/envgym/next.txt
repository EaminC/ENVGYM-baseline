current progress: The Dockerfile has successfully set up the Ubuntu 22.04 environment, installed all required system dependencies (build tools, Python packages, Gradle 6.8, Bazel 8.1.1, Android NDK/SDK), cloned the fmt repository, created all CMake/Bazel configuration files (FindSetEnv.cmake, fmt-config.cmake.in, fmt.pc.in, Bazel workspace/module files), initialized AndroidManifest.xml and mkdocs.yml, set up the Gradle wrapper, and copied Bazel files to the project root.

next step: Extend the Dockerfile to execute build, test, and validation steps including: configuring CMake builds (traditional/module/shared/hidden visibility), running ctest, generating documentation with theme verification, installing libraries, creating/running sample applications, performing Android shared library/AAR builds, setting up CI workflow files, running fuzzing/linting/timezone tests, Bazel test execution, pkg-config validation, and Windows SDK configuration checks.
