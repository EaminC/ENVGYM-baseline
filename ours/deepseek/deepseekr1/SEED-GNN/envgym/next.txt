current progress
Dockerfile successfully built and ran, installing Python 3.9 base, system dependencies, and requirements.txt packages. Environment setup completed with working directory and file copying.

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by removing build-only dependencies after package installation and clean apt cache to reduce image size. Add multi-stage build if appropriate.
