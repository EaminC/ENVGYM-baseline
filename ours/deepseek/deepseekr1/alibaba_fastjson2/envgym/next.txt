current progress
The Dockerfile is set up for a multi-stage build with proper context and file copying. However, the Maven build step in the builder stage failed during execution.

next step
Add debug flags to the Maven command to capture detailed error logs by changing to: `RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests -X`
