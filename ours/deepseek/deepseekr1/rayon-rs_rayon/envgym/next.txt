current progress: Docker image built and ran successfully, but container only starts a bash shell without executing the application binary.
next step: Modify Dockerfile CMD to launch the built release binary (e.g., `CMD ["./target/release/<binary_name>"]`) instead of starting bash; determine binary name from Cargo.toml.
