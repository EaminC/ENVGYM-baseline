current progress
Successfully built and ran the Docker image with optimized directory structure and dependency installations. Key achievements: base environment setup with Conda, all required Python packages installed, directory hierarchy created at /exli, Maven parallel build configured, and correct volume mounting points established.

next step
Add the Python package installation step to the Dockerfile: insert `RUN cd /exli/exli/python && /opt/conda/envs/exli/bin/pip install .[research]` before the WORKDIR instruction.
