Based on your hardware specifications and requirements, here's the optimized Docker plan:

```dockerfile
# Use BuildKit for advanced features and multi-core builds
# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.4

# Builder stage with build dependencies
FROM python:3.8-slim-bullseye AS builder

# Install build dependencies optimized for x86_64
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    libopenmpi-dev \
    libssl-dev \
    zlib1g-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory matching host path
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files from relative path
COPY . .

# Install Python dependencies using parallel jobs
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --jobs $(nproc) -r requirements.txt

# Final stage with minimal runtime
FROM python:3.8-slim-bullseye

# Install runtime libraries (non-dev versions)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    libopenmpi3 \
    zlib1g \
    libssl1.1 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy built artifacts from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
COPY --from=builder /app /app

# Set working directory and environment
WORKDIR /app
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app

# Default command
CMD ["python", "./main.py"]
```

Key adjustments made:

1. **CPU Optimization**:
   - Added `--jobs $(nproc)` to pip install for parallel builds using all CPU cores
   - Explicit BuildKit declaration (`syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4`)

2. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Removed unnecessary build dependencies (llvm, tk-dev, etc.)
   - Added `--no-install-recommends` to apt commands
   - Replaced development packages with runtime equivalents in final image:
     - `libopenmpi-dev` → `libopenmpi3`
     - `zlib1g-dev` → `zlib1g`
     - `libssl-dev` → `libssl1.1`

3. **Path Consistency**:
   - Maintained `/app` WORKDIR to match COPY operations
   - Preserved PYTHONPATH configuration

4. **Platform Compatibility**:
   - Confirmed python:3.8-slim-bullseye supports x86_64
   - Removed GPU-related packages per requirements

5. **Efficiency Improvements**:
   - Multi-stage build reduces final image size
   - Cache optimization via BuildKit
   - Cleaned apt caches in same layer as installs

The plan now leverages all available CPU cores during build, minimizes image size, and ensures compatibility with your x86_64 architecture and Docker version.
