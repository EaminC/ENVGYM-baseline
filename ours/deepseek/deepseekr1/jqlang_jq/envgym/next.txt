current progress: The Docker build has successfully completed the source build and installation of jq, including dependency installation, documentation setup, decNumber validation, configuration, compilation, test execution, manpage verification, and environment setup. The failure occurred during the library verification step when attempting to compile and run the test_libjq program.

next step: Modify the Dockerfile by separating the failing library verification RUN command into individual steps to isolate the failure point (pkg-config lookup, compilation, or execution), and verify the presence of libjq.pc and required header files.
