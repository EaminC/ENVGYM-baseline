current progress: The Docker build failed during the installation of `cargo-audit` in the builder stage (exit code 101), halting the entire build process. All previous steps (installing system packages, bat, bat-extras, and updating Rust) completed successfully before this failure.

next step: Modify the Dockerfile by replacing the failing `cargo install --verbose cargo-audit` command with a pinned version installation and diagnostic commands. Specifically, change:
```
RUN cargo install --verbose cargo-audit
```
to:
```
RUN echo "Installing pinned cargo-audit version" && \
    cargo install --verbose cargo-audit --version 0.17.7 && \
    echo "cargo-audit installed successfully" || \
    (echo "cargo-audit installation failed"; exit 1)
```
