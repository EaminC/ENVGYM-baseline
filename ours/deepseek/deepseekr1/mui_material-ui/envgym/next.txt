current progress
The Docker build failed due to a missing yarn.lock file during the COPY step. The Dockerfile was modified to include bash installation and changed the CMD to bash, but the core issue remains unresolved.

next step
Ensure yarn.lock exists in the build context and modify the Dockerfile by reverting CMD to ["yarn", "start"] and removing the bash installation unless required for debugging.
