Based on the hardware specifications and environment constraints, here's the adjusted Docker setup plan:

```dockerfile
# Use specified CPU-only base image compatible with x86_64
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory matching project context
WORKDIR /app

# Copy from relative path to handle parent directory context
COPY data/collected_stats/ .

# Optimize multi-core builds and install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y g++ make libopenmpi-dev python3-dev && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Create virtual environment
RUN python -m venv /app/venv

# Install requirements using virtual environment
RUN /app/venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Build with multi-core optimization
RUN /app/venv/bin/python setup.py build -j$(nproc)
RUN /app/venv/bin/python setup.py install

# Use absolute path for virtual environment in entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/venv/bin/python", "run.py"]
```

Key adjustments made:
1. Architecture compatibility: Explicitly uses `python:3.11-slim` CPU-only image for x86_64
2. Path correction: Changed `COPY` to use relative path `data/collected_stats/` to maintain context from project root
3. Multi-core optimization: Added `-j$(nproc)` to build command
4. Virtual environment handling: Replaced `source activate` with absolute paths (`/app/venv/bin/...`)
5. GPU avoidance: Confirmed no CUDA/NVIDIA components included
6. BuildKit compatibility: Maintained standard Dockerfile syntax
7. Storage optimization: Kept `apt-get clean` and `--no-cache-dir` for space reduction

The plan now respects the hardware constraints (x86_64 CPU-only environment) while maintaining correct paths relative to the EnvGym project structure.
