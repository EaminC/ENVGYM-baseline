current progress: Base image, working directory, and system dependencies are correctly configured. Virtual environment created at /app/venv. PATH environment variable set for virtual environment access. Runtime set to interactive bash shell.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to: 
  1. Change COPY instruction to target only data/collected_stats directory 
  2. Remove PATH environment variable setting 
  3. Replace CMD with ENTRYPOINT for application execution 
  4. Add requirement installation and build steps using absolute virtual environment paths 
  5. Implement multi-core build optimization with -j$(nproc) 
  6. Remove interactive shell in favor of direct application entrypoint
