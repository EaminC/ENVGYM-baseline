=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Python 3.7.x (x86_64 compatible)
   - git (x86_64 version)
   - pip (latest version)
   - virtualenv package
   - z3-solver (CPU-only version)
   - tensorflow==2.5.0 (CPU-only version)
   - aif360 (CPU-compatible version)
   - bash shell (standard Linux version)
   - Adult Census Income dataset (adult.data, adult.test, adult.names)
   - Bank Marketing dataset (bank-additional-full.csv, bank-additional-names.txt)
   - German Credit dataset (german.data, german.doc)
   - pandas (for additional data processing)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - /home/cc/EnvGym/data/Fairify/fenv/ (virtual environment directory)
   - ~/.bashrc (for environment variable setup)
   - INSTALL.md (updated with CPU-only instructions)
   - All res/ directories and readme.md files as originally specified
   - data/adult/ directory with dataset files
   - data/bank/ directory with dataset files
   - data/german/ directory with dataset files
   - All specified results directories and documentation files

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - All original test cases remain valid
   - Added CPU-specific test for tensorflow: verify no GPU dependencies
   - Added test for x86_64 architecture compatibility
   - Added test for sufficient disk space (>2GB available)
   - Added test for memory requirements (>4GB RAM available)

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   1-54: All original steps remain with following adjustments:
   - Modified step 8: pip install tensorflow-cpu==2.5.0 (instead of tensorflow)
   - Added step 55: Verify CPU-only installation: python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.test.is_gpu_available())" (should return False)
   - Added step 56: Verify system architecture: uname -m (should return x86_64)
   - Added step 57: Verify disk space: df -h /home/cc/EnvGym/data/Fairify
   - Added step 58: Verify available memory: free -h
   - All paths updated to use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/Fairify/ as base directory
   - Added warning in documentation about CPU-only execution limitations
