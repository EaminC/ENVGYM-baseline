=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - All previous downloads remain unchanged except:
   - REMOVE: Visual Studio 2022 for ARM64 builds (not compatible with Linux/amd64)
   - REMOVE: Windows ARM64 build configurations (incompatible with current platform)
   - REMOVE: Intel SDE for CET testing (x86_64 only, not needed for amd64 base)
   - ADD: Docker-in-Docker setup for cross-architecture testing
   - ADD: QEMU static binaries for cross-arch emulation
   - MODIFY: Cross-compilation toolchains to prioritize x86_64 and emulated targets

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - All previous files remain unchanged except:
   - REMOVE: Windows ARM64 build configurations
   - ADD: Docker-based cross-arch test configurations
   - ADD: QEMU emulation wrapper scripts
   - MODIFY: Cross-compilation configs to use containerized approach

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
   - All previous test cases remain unchanged except:
   - REMOVE: Visual Studio ARM64 compatibility tests
   - REMOVE: Native Windows ARM64 build tests
   - ADD: Containerized cross-architecture tests
   - ADD: QEMU-based ARM emulation validation
   - MODIFY: ARM tests to use emulation rather than native

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - All previous steps remain unchanged except:
   - REMOVE: Set up Visual Studio ARM64 compatibility tests
   - REMOVE: Configure Windows ARM64 build environment
   - ADD: Configure Docker for cross-arch emulation
   - ADD: Set up QEMU-based architecture emulation
   - MODIFY: Cross-compilation tests to use containerized approach
   - MODIFY: ARM testing to use emulation rather than native
   - ADD: Validate Docker-based test environment
   - ADD: Configure BuildKit for multi-platform builds

Key adjustments made due to hardware constraints:
- Removed Windows ARM64-specific components since we're on Linux/amd64
- Replaced native ARM testing with QEMU-based emulation
- Added containerized approaches for cross-architecture testing
- Removed Intel CET-specific items not relevant to standard amd64
- Focused on Docker-based solutions for cross-platform testing
- Maintained all x86_64 and emulated architecture support
- Kept all Linux-specific tooling and testing capabilities
