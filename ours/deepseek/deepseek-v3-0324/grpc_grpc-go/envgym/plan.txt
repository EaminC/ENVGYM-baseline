=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - [Previous list remains unchanged]
   - Additional OpenSSL configuration templates for certificate generation (x86_64 Linux version)
   - OpenSSL tools for CRL generation and management (Debian/Ubuntu package versions)
   - gRPC reflection proto files (Linux-compatible versions)
   - gRPC reflection service dependencies (Linux binaries)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - [Previous list remains unchanged]
   - All paths adjusted to use Linux-style forward slashes (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/grpc_grpc-go/security/...)
   - Ensure all generated files have Linux-compatible permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
   - Update scripts to use Linux path separators and bash shebang (#!/bin/bash)

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
   - [Previous list remains unchanged]
   - Added architecture-specific tests for x86_64 OpenSSL compatibility
   - Added tests for Debian/Ubuntu package behavior
   - Include tests for non-GPU environments
   - Verify Docker BuildKit compatibility tests

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - [Previous list remains unchanged]
   - Added: 336. Verify all paths use Linux-style forward slashes
   - Added: 337. Test OpenSSL package compatibility on Debian/Ubuntu
   - Added: 338. Validate file permissions for Linux environment
   - Added: 339. Test BuildKit compatibility for all build steps
   - Added: 340. Verify resource usage within container limits
   - Added: 341. Check storage requirements for test data generation

Note: All operations assume Linux x86_64 architecture and Docker BuildKit support. No GPU-specific adjustments needed. Paths are verified to match the working directory structure. Memory and storage requirements are within typical container limits for the described hardware.
