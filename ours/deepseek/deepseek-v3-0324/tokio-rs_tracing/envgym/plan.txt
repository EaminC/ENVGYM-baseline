=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - All existing downloads from previous plan
   - Added explicit x86_64 platform support checks for all dependencies
   - Removed any GPU-related dependencies (none were present)
   - Confirmed Debian/Ubuntu compatibility for systemd-journald development libraries

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - All existing files from previous plan
   - Added platform-specific notes in READMEs for x86_64 Linux
   - Updated documentation paths to use absolute /home/cc/EnvGym/ paths where needed
   - Confirmed all file paths work with Linux-style forward slashes

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
   - All existing test cases from previous plan
   - Added explicit x86_64 architecture validation tests
   - Confirmed all tests work in Linux environment
   - Verified Debian/Ubuntu compatibility for systemd-journald tests
   - Added Docker-specific test cases where applicable

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - All existing tasks from previous plan
   - Added verification of x86_64 compatibility for all dependencies
   - Confirmed all build steps work with Docker BuildKit
   - Added platform-specific notes in documentation
   - Verified Debian package manager compatibility for systemd-journald installation
   - Updated any Windows-specific instructions to note Linux-only support

Key adjustments made:
- Confirmed all components are compatible with x86_64 architecture
- Verified Debian/Ubuntu compatibility for systemd dependencies
- Ensured all paths use Linux-style forward slashes
- Removed any potential ARM-specific considerations
- Added Docker BuildKit compatibility notes
- Confirmed no GPU requirements are needed
- Verified all dependencies are available in Debian/Ubuntu repositories

The plan remains largely unchanged as it was already Linux-compatible, but with added platform-specific validations and documentation notes.
