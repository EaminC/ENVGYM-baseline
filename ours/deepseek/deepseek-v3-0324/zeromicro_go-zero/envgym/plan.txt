=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED (ADJUSTED):
   - Docker: Latest stable version for x86_64
   - Go programming language: Version 1.21.13 or higher (amd64 binaries)
   - GitHub Actions runner (linux/amd64 version)
   - goctl tool (amd64 build)
   - All CLI tools (CodeQL, Codecov, act, kubectl) - amd64 versions
   - Minikube or kind - linux/amd64 builds
   - etcd: Latest x86_64 version
   - MySQL client tools (amd64 binaries)
   - protoc compiler (linux-x86_64)
   - MongoDB tools (amd64 packages)
   - Redis server (amd64 build)
   - PostgreSQL tools (x86_64 packages)
   - Jaeger tracing tools (amd64 binaries)
   - All Docker images specified as linux/amd64:
     - quay.io/coreos/etcd:latest
     - golang:1.22-alpine (amd64 variant)
     - alpine (amd64 base image)

2. FILES TO CREATE (UNCHANGED - all paths correct for Linux):
   - [Same as original list, all paths compatible with Linux filesystem]

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES (ADJUSTED):
   - Added: Architecture-specific validation for all binaries (verify amd64)
   - Added: Docker platform verification (linux/amd64)
   - Removed: Any ARM-specific test cases
   - Added: x86_64 performance benchmarking tests
   - Modified: Resource constraint tests to match available hardware

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTED):
   - Verify all downloads are amd64 versions
   - Test Docker builds with platform=linux/amd64
   - Validate all tools work on x86_64 architecture
   - Remove any ARM-specific build configurations
   - Add architecture verification steps to CI pipelines
   - Update documentation to specify x86_64 requirements
   - Add resource monitoring for memory-intensive operations
   - Verify storage requirements fit within available space
   - Test all components without GPU acceleration

Key adjustments made:
- Specified amd64 architecture for all downloads
- Ensured platform compatibility with linux/amd64
- Removed unnecessary GPU-related considerations
- Added architecture verification steps
- Maintained all standard Linux paths and configurations
- Kept storage requirements within typical x86_64 system capabilities
- Adjusted resource expectations based on non-GPU system
