=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN (x86_64 CPU ONLY) ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Python 3.7 (x86_64 compatible version)
   - conda (Miniconda recommended for x86_64 Linux)
   - Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit OS (confirmed compatible)
   - CSV files from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/6388301)
   - Modified pip packages (CPU-only versions):
     - scikit-learn
     - numpy (no AVX2 optimization needed)
     - matplotlib
     - pandas
     - jsonpickle
     - nearpy
     - treeinterpreter
     - cleanlab

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - requirements.txt (updated with CPU-only dependencies)
   - install.sh (modified for x86_64 paths)
   - /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/plots/
   - /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/models/
   - /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/results/
   - /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/csvs/
   - /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/subcategories/

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - All original tests except GPU-related functionality
   - Additional test for CPU-only numpy operations
   - Verify paths in /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/
   - Test directory creation with absolute paths

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   1. Confirm Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit installation
   2. Install Miniconda for x86_64 Linux
   3. Update install.sh with:
      - Absolute paths (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/)
      - CPU-only package installations
   4. Run modified install.sh to:
      - Create conda environment with Python 3.7
      - Set up all directories with full paths
   5. Update requirements.txt (remove any GPU dependencies)
   6. Install CPU-compatible dependencies
   7. Download CSV files to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/csvs/
   8. Verify paths for all test cases
   9. All remaining original test steps (12-20) with path adjustments
   10. Add CPU utilization monitoring during heavy computations
   11. Verify memory usage stays within system limits

Note: Removed all GPU-specific considerations, standardized on x86_64 builds, and adjusted all paths to use the full /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sixthsense/ location. Added validation steps for CPU-only operation.
