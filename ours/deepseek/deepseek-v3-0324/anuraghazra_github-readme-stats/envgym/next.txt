current progress: Base Docker setup completed with Node.js environment, working directory configured, and basic dependencies installed. Build and runtime execution successful.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to match adjusted plan by updating WORKDIR path, adjusting COPY destination, and verifying x86_64 compatibility. Remove unnecessary CMD and ensure proper volume mapping.
