current progress: Dockerfile successfully built and executed with all specified binaries (kind, kubectl, helm, kustomize, helm-docs, gocovmerge) installed, Python environment set up with required packages, and directory structure created at /home/cc/EnvGym/data/acto/

next step: Verify all installed component versions match the plan requirements, test Kubernetes cluster creation using Kind, and validate Python virtual environment functionality with the installed dependencies
