Here's the adjusted plan based on your hardware information:

```
Plan:
1. Environment Setup:
   - Base Image: Use linux/amd64 compatible image (debian:stable-slim recommended)
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sveltejs_svelte (confirmed valid)
   - No GPU-specific configurations needed

2. Build Configuration:
   - Docker multi-stage builds supported (v0.23.0)
   - Standard x86_64 architecture builds
   - Use BuildKit features for optimization

3. Runtime Configuration:
   - No CUDA or GPU-related settings required
   - Standard Linux container runtime
   - Memory limits can be set based on available host RAM

4. Path Validation:
   - All paths remain as specified in original plan
   - Working directory confirmed for Linux filesystem

5. Toolchain:
   - Use standard amd64 binaries for all tools
   - No ARM-specific packages needed
   - Compatible with Docker Compose v2.35.1

6. Storage:
   - Ensure sufficient space in /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sveltejs_svelte
   - Consider Docker storage driver limitations if applicable

Note: All components are compatible with x86_64 architecture and standard Linux container runtime. No GPU-specific adjustments needed.
