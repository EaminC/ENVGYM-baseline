Here's the adjusted plan based on your hardware information:

1. System Requirements:
   - Architecture: x86_64 (compatible)
   - Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
   - Docker Version: 28.1.1 or higher (already meets requirement)
   - No GPU support needed (Matrox G200eW3 confirmed)
   - Storage: Ensure at least 20GB free space in /home/cc/EnvGym/data

2. Directory Structure:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/ELECT (confirmed)
   - Parent Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data (confirmed)
   - All paths should use absolute references from /home/cc/EnvGym/data

3. Docker Configuration:
   - Base Image: Use amd64-compatible image (ubuntu:20.04 or debian:bullseye)
   - Disable GPU-related configurations
   - Build command should include: --platform=linux/amd64
   - No CUDA or cuDNN dependencies needed

4. Software Installation:
   - Install only CPU-compatible packages
   - Skip any GPU-accelerated libraries
   - Use standard x86_64 binaries for all tools

5. Memory Considerations:
   - Monitor memory usage during execution
   - Adjust workload based on available RAM (no GPU memory to consider)

6. Path Adjustments:
   - All file paths should be relative to /home/cc/EnvGym/data
   - Ensure proper permissions for /home/cc/EnvGym/data directory

7. Execution:
   - Run all processes with CPU-only flags
   - Disable any GPU-specific optimization flags
   - Set environment variable: ELECT_NO_GPU=1

8. Verification:
   - Check all tools for x86_64 compatibility
   - Verify CPU-only operation mode
   - Confirm paths resolve correctly within /home/cc/EnvGym/data hierarchy

Note: The plan has been simplified by removing all GPU-related components and optimized for your x86_64 CPU architecture with the specified directory structure.
