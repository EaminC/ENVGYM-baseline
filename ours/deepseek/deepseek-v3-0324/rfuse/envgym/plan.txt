Here's the adjusted plan based on the hardware information:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimized size and security
FROM ubuntu:22.04 as builder

# Set working directory matching host system
WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse

# Install build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git \
    wget \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Build and install any required components
# (Add specific build instructions here)

# Final lightweight image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Maintain compatibility with host architecture
ARG TARGETARCH=amd64

# Copy built artifacts from builder
COPY --from=builder /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse /app

# Set working directory to match host
WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse

# Install runtime dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
    # List runtime dependencies here
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Since no GPU is available, exclude CUDA/NVIDIA dependencies
# Add any CPU-only alternatives if needed

# Configure environment
ENV PATH="/app/bin:${PATH}"

# Ensure proper permissions
RUN chmod -R a+rwx /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse

# Entry point or command
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

Key adjustments made:
1. Used Ubuntu 22.04 as base image (amd64-compatible)
2. Removed any GPU-specific configurations
3. Aligned working directory with host system (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse)
4. Simplified to CPU-only environment
5. Maintained x86_64 architecture compatibility
6. Used multi-stage build for optimization
7. Ensured proper path permissions matching host system
