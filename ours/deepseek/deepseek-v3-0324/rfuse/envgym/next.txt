current progress
Dockerfile structure set up with multi-stage build, dependencies installed, repository cloned, and build process defined. Previous error was due to missing requirements.txt file during copy operation.

next step
Ensure requirements.txt exists in build context and is properly copied, then verify build process completes successfully before runtime.
