Adjusted Environment Configuration Plan:

1. Base System:
   - Use Debian 12 (bookworm) as base image (optimal for x86_64 architecture)
   - No GPU-specific components needed (confirmed no NVIDIA/CUDA)
   - Standard Linux toolchain (gcc, make, etc.)

2. Working Directory Structure:
   - Maintain path: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/alibaba_fastjson2
   - Ensure proper permissions for the directory
   - Verify sufficient disk space (minimum 5GB recommended)

3. Development Tools:
   - JDK 11 (LTS version recommended for stability)
   - Maven 3.8.x for Java dependency management
   - Git for version control

4. Container Configuration:
   - Dockerfile to use multi-stage builds (BuildKit supported)
   - Standard x86_64 platform target (--platform=linux/amd64)
   - Memory limits: Minimum 4GB RAM recommended for Java builds
   - CPU cores: Minimum 2 cores recommended

5. Path Validation:
   - Verify all paths in configuration are absolute and correct
   - Ensure Docker build context includes all necessary files

6. Monitoring:
   - Add disk space monitoring in container
   - Include memory usage checks for Java processes

7. Compatibility Notes:
   - All components verified for x86_64 architecture
   - No ARM-specific optimizations needed
   - No GPU acceleration required
   - Docker version compatibility confirmed (v28.1.1)

8. Additional Recommendations:
   - Consider adding health checks in Docker configuration
   - Include cleanup steps in Dockerfile to minimize image size
   - Verify network access for dependency downloads
