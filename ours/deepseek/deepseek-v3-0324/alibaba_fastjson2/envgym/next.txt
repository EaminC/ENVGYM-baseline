current progress
Build failed during dependency installation in Stage 1 (builder) with exit code 100, likely due to package availability or network issues. Runtime stage not reached.

next step
Modify Dockerfile to: 1) Add retry logic for apt-get, 2) Verify package names in Debian 12, 3) Split installation into separate RUN commands for debugging, 4) Add network connectivity checks.
