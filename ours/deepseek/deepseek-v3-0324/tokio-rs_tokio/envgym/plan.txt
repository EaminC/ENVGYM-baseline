Here's the adjusted environment setup plan based on the x86_64 hardware specifications:

=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - All original Rust toolchain and dependencies remain unchanged
   - Remove any ARM-specific dependencies or cross-compilation tools not needed for x86_64
   - Keep io-uring support (compatible with x86_64 Linux)
   - Remove any GPU-related dependencies (none present in original plan)
   - Keep all standard Linux dependencies (mio, nix, etc.)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - All original files remain relevant
   - Modify Cross.toml to focus only on x86_64 targets:
     ```
     [build.env]
     passthrough = [
         "RUSTFLAGS",
         "RUST_BACKTRACE",
         "TRYBUILD",
     ]
     
     [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
     image = "rust:latest"
     ```
   - Keep target-specs/i686-unknown-linux-gnu.json (compatible with x86_64)
   - Remove any ARM-specific target configurations

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - Keep all original test cases except:
     - Remove ARM-specific platform tests
     - Keep io-uring tests (Linux/x86_64 compatible)
     - Remove any GPU-related tests (none present)
     - Focus on x86_64 performance characteristics
     - Keep FreeBSD tests (can run on x86_64)

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - All original tasks remain except:
     - Remove ARM cross-compilation setup
     - Focus CI/CD on x86_64 Linux
     - Skip GPU-specific configurations
     - Optimize memory usage for available RAM
     - Ensure paths use /home/cc/EnvGym/... structure
     - Keep Docker setup using standard x86_64 images
     - Remove any GPU driver installation steps
     - Keep stress tests but adjust for x86_64 performance characteristics
     - Adjust benchmark thresholds for x86_64 hardware

Key adjustments made:
1. Removed any unnecessary cross-platform considerations (focus on x86_64)
2. Kept io-uring support which is relevant for x86_64 Linux
3. Simplified Cross.toml configuration for single-architecture builds
4. Maintained all x86_64-compatible tests and benchmarks
5. Ensured paths match /home/cc/EnvGym/... structure
6. Removed any GPU-related configurations that weren't needed
7. Kept stress testing but with x86_64 performance expectations

All other aspects of the original plan remain valid for the x86_64 Linux environment.
