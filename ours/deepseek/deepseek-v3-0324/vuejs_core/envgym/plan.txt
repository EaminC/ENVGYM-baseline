=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - All previously listed packages remain valid for x86_64 Linux
   - Added linux-arm64 for cross-platform compatibility testing
   - Removed GPU-specific dependencies (none were present originally)
   - Added check for /home/cc/EnvGym/data/vuejs_core directory permissions

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - All original files remain valid
   - Added .dockerignore for Docker builds
   - Added Dockerfile with multi-stage build targeting linux/amd64
   - Added scripts/check-permissions.js for directory validation

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - Added x86_64 architecture validation tests
   - Added Linux filesystem permission tests
   - Added Docker build compatibility tests
   - Added memory usage monitoring tests
   - Added storage space validation tests
   - Added Linux-specific path handling tests

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - Added between steps 440-441:
     - 440.5 Validate x86_64 architecture compatibility
     - 440.6 Test Linux filesystem permissions
     - 440.7 Implement Docker build verification
     - 440.8 Add memory usage monitoring
     - 440.9 Verify storage space requirements
   - All other original todos remain valid
   - Added after step 605:
     - 606. Verify Linux-specific path handling
     - 607. Test cross-platform build consistency
     - 608. Document Linux-specific setup notes

The plan remains largely unchanged as it was already compatible with standard Linux x86_64 environments. The main adjustments focus on:
- Explicit Linux compatibility validation
- Docker support for the given architecture
- Filesystem permission checks
- Path handling for the specified working directory
- Memory and storage monitoring

No GPU-related adjustments were needed as the hardware doesn't include GPU capabilities and the original plan didn't require them. The multi-package monorepo structure remains suitable for the given environment.
