=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust toolchain (version 1.74 or later, STABLE=1.89)
   - Cargo (Rust package manager, bundled with Rust)
   - clap crate (version 4.5.46)
   - clap_builder (version 4.5.46)
   - clap_derive (version 4.5.45, optional)
   - Git (for version control and cloning examples)
   - Renovate (for dependency management)
   - Probot Settings app (for GitHub settings sync)
   - cargo-deny (for license and dependency checks)
   - cargo-release (for release management)
   - cargo-typos (for spell checking)
   - pre-commit (for git hook management)
   - Additional dev dependencies:
     - trybuild (1.0.91)
     - rustversion (1.0.15)
     - trycmd (0.15.3)
     - jiff (0.2.3)
     - snapbox (0.6.16)
     - shlex (1.3.0)
     - automod (1.0.14)
     - clap-cargo (0.15.0)
   - WASM toolchain (for wasm builds)
   - Debug feature dependencies (for clap development)
   - New dependencies from Cargo.lock (same as original list)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - All files from original plan remain the same
   - Added clarification in .cargo/config.toml for x86_64:
     ```
     [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
     linker = "cc"
     ```

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - All original test cases remain
   - Added specific x86_64 platform tests:
     - Test x86_64-specific optimizations
     - Verify 64-bit memory addressing
     - Test SSE/AVX instruction compatibility

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - Install Rust 1.74 for x86_64:
     `rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - Set default toolchain:
     `rustup default stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - Verify architecture:
     `rustc --version --verbose | grep host`
   - For WASM builds:
     `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   - All other setup steps remain the same as original plan
   - Added verification steps:
     - Check `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/clap-rs_clap` permissions
     - Verify sufficient disk space (minimum 5GB recommended)
     - Check Linux kernel version compatibility

5. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC NOTES:
   - Removed ARM-specific toolchain mentions
   - Removed GPU-related configurations
   - Optimized for standard Linux x86_64 tooling
   - Adjusted paths to use absolute paths where needed
   - Verified Docker compatibility with x86_64 platform
   - Confirmed BuildKit support for x86_64 builds

6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Set up swap if system has <4GB RAM
   - Configure cargo to use all CPU cores:
     `export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=$(nproc)`
   - Enable incremental compilation in development

All other aspects of the original plan remain unchanged as they are compatible with the x86_64 Linux environment. The adjusted plan focuses on optimizing for the given hardware specifications while maintaining all functionality.
