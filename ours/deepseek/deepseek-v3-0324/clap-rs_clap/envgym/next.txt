current progress
- Dockerfile setup with Rust 1.74 for x86_64
- Basic dependencies installed (git, build tools)
- Rust toolchain configured for x86_64 and WASM
- Cargo config created for x86_64 linking
- Lockfile generated and dependencies fetched
- Build failed at dependency compilation step (clap_builder, clap_derive, clap_lex)

next step
- Investigate specific build error from clap_builder compilation
- Add debugging tools (lldb, gdb) to Dockerfile
- Add more verbose error logging
- Consider splitting build steps into separate RUN commands for isolation
- Verify dependency versions match Cargo.lock
- Check for missing system libraries
