current progress: Dockerfile successfully builds with basic environment setup including compilers (g++-9, clang 6.0-15), build tools (CMake, Meson, Bazelisk), testing frameworks (Catch2), documentation tools (Doxygen), and package managers (vcpkg, Conan). Core dependencies for x86_64 Linux are installed.

next step: Add remaining items from TODO list: JUnit report generator, CTest configuration, GPG setup, guardonce validation, and optimize the installation order to reduce layers. Verify all installed versions match the specified requirements in the plan.
