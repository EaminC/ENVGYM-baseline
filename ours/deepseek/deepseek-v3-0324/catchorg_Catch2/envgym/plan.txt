=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Catch2 v3.10.0 (specific version from GitHub)
   - g++ 9+ (primary compiler for x86_64)
   - CMake 3.16+
   - Meson 0.54.1+
   - Conan 1.53.0+ and 2.1
   - Git (for cloning the repository)
   - Python 3 (for test scripts and development builds)
   - Ninja (preferred build system for Linux/amd64)
   - Doxygen 1.9.1+ (for documentation)
   - Graphviz (for diagram generation)
   - MathJax (for formula rendering)
   - GDB (for debugging)
   - clang-format (for code formatting)
   - vcpkg (optional, for package management)
   - Bazel (required for Bazel builds)
   - Bazelisk (for Bazel version management)
   - pkg-config (for alternative builds)
   - CTest (for parallel test execution)
   - JUnit report generator (for CI integration)
   - GitHub CLI (for PR validation)
   - clang-6.0 to clang-14 (for various builds)
   - clang-15 (for clang-tidy)
   - clang-tidy-15 (for static analysis)
   - valgrind (for memory checking)
   - pip (for Python package management)
   - guardonce (for header guard validation)
   - GPG (for maintainer key verification)

   REMOVED/ADJUSTED ITEMS:
   - Removed: IAR compiler (not relevant for x86_64 Linux)
   - Removed: MPI (not specified in hardware)
   - Removed: Android NDK (not needed for x86_64)
   - Removed: DJGPP cross-compiler (not needed)
   - Removed: macOS SDK/Xcode tools (Linux environment)
   - Removed: Windows SDK/MSVC tools (Linux environment)
   - Simplified compiler versions to focus on x86_64 compatible versions

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   (No changes needed, all files are architecture-independent)

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
   - Focus on x86_64-specific tests:
     - Keep all standard compliance tests (C++14/17/20)
     - Keep all CMake/Meson/Bazel build tests
     - Keep all static analysis and memory tests
     - Keep all documentation and CI integration tests
   
   REMOVED/ADJUSTED TESTS:
   - Removed: Android logging tests
   - Removed: DJGPP compatibility tests
   - Removed: Windows platform specific tests
   - Removed: macOS/Xcode specific tests
   - Removed: ARM64 architecture tests
   - Simplified compiler compatibility tests to focus on x86_64 toolchains

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - Focus on Linux/x86_64 specific setup:
     1.5 Install clang-format
     1.7 Install Bazel and Bazelisk
     1.13 Install pkg-config
     1.14 Install CTest
     1.15 Install JUnit report generator
     1.17 Install GitHub CLI
     1.18 Configure Bazel cache
     1.19 Install ninja-build
     1.20 Install clang-6.0 to clang-14
     1.21 Install clang-15 and clang-tidy-15
     1.23 Install valgrind
     1.26 Install pip
     1.27 Install Conan versions 1.63 and 2.1
     1.28 Install guardonce
     1.32 Install GPG
     
   REMOVED/ADJUSTED TASKS:
   - Removed all Windows/macOS specific setup tasks
   - Removed ARM/Android/DJGPP specific tasks
   - Simplified compiler installation to x86_64 compatible versions
   - Removed MPI-related setup
   - Kept all x86_64 architecture validation tasks
   - Kept all Linux-specific build and test configuration tasks

The plan has been streamlined to focus on the x86_64 Linux environment while maintaining all core functionality and testing requirements. All platform-specific components for non-Linux or non-x86_64 architectures have been removed to match the actual hardware configuration.
