current progress: Dockerfile successfully builds and runs with Ubuntu 20.04 base, installs all required packages, clones necessary repositories, creates directory structure, and initializes empty files.

next step: Add configuration file templates and test scripts, implement kernel version installation, set up NFS-Ganesha configuration, and add resource limit parameters for container.
