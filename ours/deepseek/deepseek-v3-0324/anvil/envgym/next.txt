current progress: Docker build failed during Verus compilation step (cargo build) with exit code 101. All prerequisite installations and setup completed successfully up to this point.

next step: Investigate Verus compilation error by adding debug output, checking Rust toolchain compatibility, and verifying dependency versions match Verus requirements.
