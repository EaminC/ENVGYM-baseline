=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED (ADJUSTED):
   - fmtlib/fmt repository (latest stable release)
   - CMake (version 3.8-3.28, with 3.12+ recommended)
   - C++ compiler (GCC 8+ or Clang 7+)
   - Python 3 (for running benchmarks and tests)
   - git (for repository cloning)
   - Doxygen (optional, for documentation generation)
   - Ninja (optional, for faster builds)
   - MkDocs (optional, for documentation generation)
   - Fuzzing tools (libFuzzer/AFL++, optional)
   - Bazel (for Bazel builds)
   - Bzlmod (for Bazel dependency management)
   - CMake modules from support directory
   - Build scripts from support directory
   - CMake package utilities (for fmt-config.cmake generation)
   - pkg-config (for .pc file handling)
   - Android NDK (version 21.3.6528147 or compatible)
   - Gradle (version 6.1+ for Android Gradle Plugin 4.1.1)
   - Android SDK (compileSdkVersion 25)
   - Java Development Kit (for Gradle)
   - Android.mk build system tools

   REMOVED:
   - CUDA toolkit (no GPU support available)
   - MSVC compiler (Linux environment)
   - Android Studio (marked as optional)

2. FILES TO CREATE (ADJUSTED):
   - Same as original, but with note that CUDA-related files won't be needed
   - All paths should use Linux-style (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/fmtlib_fmt/)

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES (ADJUSTED):
   - All original tests EXCEPT:
     - CUDA integration tests
   - Added:
     - Verify x86_64 architecture compatibility
     - Test Linux-specific path handling
     - Validate Docker environment constraints

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTED):
   - Remove all CUDA-related tasks (34, etc.)
   - Focus on x86_64 Linux-specific setup
   - Update paths to use /home/cc/EnvGym/data/fmtlib_fmt/
   - Skip MSVC-specific tests
   - Add step: Verify Docker container constraints
   - Add step: Check filesystem permissions in Docker environment
   - Add step: Validate Linux package manager integration

KEY ADJUSTMENTS:
1. Removed all CUDA-related components and tests (no GPU support)
2. Focused on Linux/x86_64 toolchain (GCC/Clang)
3. Updated paths to match working directory
4. Added Docker environment verification steps
5. Removed Windows/MSVC-specific components
6. Kept Android support as it can run in emulation
7. Ensured all paths use Linux-style forward slashes

NOTE: The plan maintains all core functionality while removing GPU-specific components and adapting to the Linux/Docker environment constraints.
