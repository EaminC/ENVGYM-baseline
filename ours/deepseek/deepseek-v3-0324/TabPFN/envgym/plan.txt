Here's the adjusted environment setup plan based on your hardware information:

=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Python 3.9+ (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13)
   - pip (latest version)
   - Git
   - TabPFN package (via pip or source)
   - TabPFN model weights (auto-downloaded or manual)
   - uv (pip replacement)
   - Core dependencies (same as original)
   - Development tools (same as original)
   - REMOVED: CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN (no GPU detected)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - Adjusted .env file:
     ```
     TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/home/cc/EnvGym/data/TabPFN/models
     TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET=false
     TABPFN_EXCLUDE_DEVICES=mps
     FORCE_CONSISTENCY_TESTS=0
     ```
     (Removed PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF as no GPU is present)
   - requirements-dev.txt (same as original)
   - .pre-commit-config.yaml (same as original)
   - .github/dependabot.yml (same as original)
   - .github/workflows/pull_request.yml (same as original)
   - tests/reference_predictions/ (same as original)

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES IN THE CODEBASE:
   - Removed GPU-specific test cases (keeping CPU compatibility tests)
   - Kept all other test cases except those specifically for CUDA/GPU
   - Added emphasis on CPU memory management tests
   - Added x86_64 architecture-specific test validation

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   1-3, 5-16 same as original
   REMOVED: 4. (Optional) Install CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN for GPU support
   ADJUSTED: 9. Create .env file with adjusted configurations (no GPU settings)
   ADJUSTED: 15. Verify installation (CPU-only version):
        - Run Python interpreter
        - Execute: `from tabpfn import TabPFNClassifier; clf = TabPFNClassifier(device='cpu')`

Key adjustments made:
- Removed all GPU/CUDA-related components since no NVIDIA GPU is detected
- Updated .env file paths to match your working directory and removed GPU-specific settings
- Simplified installation verification to use CPU-only mode
- Maintained all CPU-specific and development-related components
- Kept architecture-specific testing for x86_64
- Maintained all Linux/amd64 compatible components
