Adjusted Environment Setup Plan:

1. Base System Configuration:
   - Platform: linux/amd64 (x86_64 architecture)
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data/mui_material-ui
   - No GPU-specific configurations needed (Matrox controller detected)

2. Docker Setup:
   - Base Image: node:lts (official image for amd64 architecture)
   - Build System: Docker BuildKit enabled
   - Version: Compatible with Docker 28.1.1
   - No CUDA/NVIDIA-related configurations required

3. Development Environment:
   - Node.js: Latest LTS version (amd64 compatible)
   - Package Manager: npm (bundled with Node.js)
   - No GPU-accelerated packages needed

4. Paths and Directories:
   - All paths remain unchanged (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/mui_material-ui)
   - Volume mounts should use absolute paths

5. Resource Considerations:
   - CPU: Standard x86_64 optimization
   - Memory: No special requirements
   - Storage: Standard node_modules space allocation
   - Network: Standard internet access for package installation

6. Build Process:
   - Standard Docker multi-stage build
   - No architecture-specific build flags required
   - No GPU-related build steps needed

7. Runtime Configuration:
   - No special runtime requirements
   - No GPU-related environment variables needed
   - Standard port mappings

Note: All original non-GPU related configurations remain unchanged as they are compatible with the x86_64 architecture and available hardware.
