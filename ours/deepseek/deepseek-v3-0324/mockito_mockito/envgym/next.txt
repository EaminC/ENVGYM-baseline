current progress: Dockerfile successfully builds and runs with Ubuntu 22.04 base, includes JDK 11/17/21 installations, Android SDK setup, Gradle wrapper configuration, KVM setup for Android emulation, and proper file permissions

next step: Add remaining components from plan (GraalVM, additional plugins, test libraries), verify all dependencies are correctly installed, and optimize image size by cleaning temporary files
