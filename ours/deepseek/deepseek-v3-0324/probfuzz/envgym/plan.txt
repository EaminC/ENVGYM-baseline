=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED (ADJUSTMENTS):
   - Python 2.7 (x86_64 compatible version)
   - Python 3.7 (x86_64 compatible version)
   - Stan (PyStan package - CPU-only version)
   - Edward (TensorFlow backend 1.5.0 - CPU-only version)
   - Pyro 0.2.1 (with PyTorch 0.4.0 CPU-only version)
   - pip package manager (for x86_64 architecture)
   - bc utility (standard Linux x86_64 package)
   - virtualenv (x86_64 compatible)
   - ANTLR 4.7.1 (antlr4-python2-runtime for x86_64)
   - antlr-4.7.1-complete.jar (standard Java version)
   - OpenJDK 8 (instead of Oracle Java, better for Docker/headless environments)
   - Remove all GPU-specific dependencies/requirements

2. FILES TO CREATE (NO CHANGES NEEDED):
   [Same as original plan, all paths are compatible with Linux x86_64]

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES (ADJUSTMENTS):
   - Remove any GPU-specific verification tests
   - Add CPU-only backend verification tests
   - Verify OpenJDK 8 instead of Oracle Java 8
   - Add test for headless environment compatibility
   - Verify all components work without CUDA support
   - Add memory usage monitoring during tests (important for containerized environment)
   - Verify Docker container compatibility tests

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTMENTS):
   - Install OpenJDK 8 instead of Oracle Java: `apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk`
   - Use CPU-only versions for all ML frameworks:
     - `pip install tensorflow==1.5.0 --no-cache-dir`
     - `pip install torch==0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html`
   - Add memory monitoring step during test execution
   - Verify container-compatible paths in all scripts
   - Add cleanup step for Docker container resources
   - Update installation checks for CPU-only versions:
     - `pip show tensorflow | grep -i gpu` should return empty
     - `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"` should return False
   - Add Docker-specific verification:
     - `docker info` to verify Docker daemon running
     - `docker build` test for containerization
   - Update path checks for Linux x86_64 environment
   - Verify all file operations work within container constraints

NOTES:
- All adjustments maintain original functionality while ensuring compatibility with:
  - x86_64 architecture
  - Linux environment (Debian/Ubuntu base)
  - Headless/containerized operation
  - CPU-only computation
  - Docker environment constraints
- Removed all GPU-specific requirements and tests
- Added verification steps for container compatibility
- Switched to OpenJDK for better container support
