current progress: Dockerfile successfully builds and runs with core dependencies installed, nlohmann/json cloned at v3.12.0, test directories created, required files downloaded via wget, bazel installed, CMake build and tests executed successfully.

next step: Add installation of remaining dependencies (Hedley, ABI checker, filesystem libraries), implement fuzzer compilation and test corpus setup, integrate clang-tidy and clang-format checks, add Bazel build configuration.
