3. NECESSARY TEST CASES (ADJUSTED):
   - Removed all macOS/iOS/Windows-specific tests
   - Removed GPU-related tests
   - Removed XCode/Visual Studio specific tests
   - Focused on x86_64 Linux compatibility tests
   - Kept all standard C++ and Linux-compatible tests
   - Maintained all fuzzing and sanitizer tests
   - Kept all module and standard library feature tests
   - Maintained all Bazel build system tests

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST (ADJUSTED):
   - Removed all macOS/Windows-specific installation steps
   - Removed GPU-related configuration
   - Removed XCode/Visual Studio setup
   - Simplified to x86_64 Linux toolchain setup
   - Focused on standard Linux build tools (CMake, Bazel, GCC, Clang)
   - Maintained all core functionality testing
   - Kept all fuzzer and sanitizer setup
   - Simplified CI pipeline to Linux-only
   - Removed natvis-related tasks
   - Removed ARM-specific container tests
   - Simplified debug visualization to Linux tools

Key adjustments made:

3. Removed ARM-specific tests and containers
4. Removed GPU-related components (unavailable)
5. Simplified to x86_64 Linux toolchain
6. Maintained all core functionality and standard compliance tests
7. Kept all fuzzing and sanitizer capabilities
8. Simplified CI/CD to Linux-only pipeline
9. Removed platform-specific debug visualization tools
10. Maintained all standard C++ feature tests and build system tests
