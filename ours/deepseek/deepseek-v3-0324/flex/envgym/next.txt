current progress: Dockerfile setup with Ubuntu 20.04 base, Miniconda installation, basic dependencies, and environment configuration. Build failed during conda environment creation and package installation.

next step: Modify Dockerfile to fix conda environment activation issues, verify package versions compatibility, and ensure proper directory structure creation. Add error handling and logging for debugging.
