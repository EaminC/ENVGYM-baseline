current progress

Successfully built Docker image with Ubuntu 20.04, installed Git, Miniconda, created conda environment with Python 3.6, installed CPU-only PyTorch 1.6.0 and torchvision 0.7.0, installed matplotlib, scipy 1.5.2, pycocotools, cloned RelTR repository, created necessary directories (ckpt, data/vg/images, data/oi/images), attempted FPN compilation, cleaned __pycache__ directories, and verified PyTorch installation.

next step

Download pre-trained model weights (checkpoint0149.pth and checkpoint0149_oi.pth) from Google Drive to ckpt/ directory, download Visual Genome dataset (images Part1/Part2 and COCO-format annotations), download Open Images V6 dataset (original annotations and images), implement process.py execution for image renaming, modify inference scripts to ensure CPU-only execution, and add test commands for inference and evaluation with CPU flags.
