current progress
The Dockerfile build failed during the Go module initialization step. The error occurred when trying to run `go mod init` and `go mod tidy` in the case where go.mod is not found. The build process couldn't complete the module initialization, likely due to missing Go source files or an empty directory structure.

next step
Add a step to check if Go source files exist before attempting module initialization, and modify the RUN command to handle empty directories gracefully. Replace the current go.mod handling section with a more robust check that first verifies the presence of .go files, and only attempts module operations if Go code is present. If no Go files exist, skip the module initialization and proceed directly to the build step with appropriate error handling.
