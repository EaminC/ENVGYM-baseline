current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Ubuntu 20.04 base that includes all essential build tools (git, gcc, clang, autotools), development libraries (flex, bison, pkg-config, libonig-dev), testing tools (valgrind, gdb), and Python environment (python3.8, pip, pipenv). The jq repository has been cloned with submodules initialized, and jq has been successfully built and installed using the bundled oniguruma.

next step

Create the planned scripts and configuration files by adding RUN commands to generate the helper scripts (install-deps.sh, build.sh, test-installation.sh, etc.) and test data files (sample.json, package.json, etc.) as specified in the environment setup plan. Also add the .gitattributes file and create the necessary directory structure (scripts/, test/, vendor/, build/, config/m4/, m4/).
