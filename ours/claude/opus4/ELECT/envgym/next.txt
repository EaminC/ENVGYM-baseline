current progress
Successfully created and tested a basic Ubuntu 20.04 Docker environment with Python and essential build tools installed. The container builds and runs without errors, establishing a functional base environment for the ELECT project.

next step
Add project-specific dependencies and configurations to the Dockerfile, including checking for and installing any Python packages from requirements.txt, setting up proper user permissions, and configuring any environment-specific settings needed for the ELECT application to run properly.
