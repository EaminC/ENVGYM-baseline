current progress

Successfully built a multi-stage Docker image that:
- Installs Rust toolchain and build dependencies in builder stage
- Clones and builds bat from source with all submodules
- Creates a runtime image with bat binary installed
- Sets up configuration files for both user and system-wide settings
- Installs shell completions and man pages
- Configures environment variables and aliases in .bashrc
- Builds syntax/theme cache

next step

Add optional dependencies (fzf, fd, ripgrep, xclip, jq, prettybat dependencies) and create test files to verify functionality:
- Install fzf, fd-find, ripgrep, xclip, jq packages
- Add prettybat dependencies (prettier, shfmt)
- Create test syntax files for new languages (Typst, VHDL, GDScript, Idris 2)
- Add syntax mapping configurations for new file extensions
- Create multilingual test files (Japanese, Korean, Russian, Chinese)
- Add verification commands to test bat functionality with different features
