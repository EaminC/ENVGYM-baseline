current progress

Successfully built a working Dockerfile that:
- Installs most required system dependencies (compilers, libraries, tools)
- Sets up Rust toolchain with multiple targets (x86_64, i686, musl, wasm32)
- Installs cargo extensions (cargo-deb, cross)
- Builds ripgrep successfully in release mode
- Verifies the build by running `rg --version`

next step

Add missing dependencies and tools:
- Install `cargo-binstall`, `cargo-outdated`, `cargo-timing`
- Add cross-compilation strip utilities for various architectures
- Install benchmarking tools (ag, ucg, pt, sift, ugrep)
- Add `pzstd` command (currently only zstd is installed)
- Set up cross-compilation Docker images access
- Create required directories and configuration files as specified in the plan
