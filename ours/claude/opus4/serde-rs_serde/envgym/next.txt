current progress

The Docker image has been successfully built with all required Rust toolchains (1.56.0 through 1.81.0, beta, nightly), components (rustfmt, clippy, miri), targets (thumbv7m-none-eabi, wasm32-unknown-emscripten), and cargo extensions installed. The working directory is set to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/serde-rs_serde and all files are copied into the container.

next step

Add RUN commands to the Dockerfile to create the project structure and implement the serde workspace according to the plan: create directories (serde, serde_derive, serde_derive_internals, test_suite, examples), copy provided configuration files, create source files with initial implementations, set up symlinks, and verify the build with various feature combinations.
