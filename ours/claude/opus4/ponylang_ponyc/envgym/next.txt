current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Ubuntu 20.04 base, installed all required system packages (build tools, Python, LLVM 15, CMake, Node.js), development libraries, monitoring tools, Google Test/Benchmark frameworks, and attempted to build Pony compiler from source. The build process reached the compilation stage but specific build results are unclear from the execution log.

next step

Add verification steps after the build to confirm Pony compiler installation success, test the ponyc binary exists and works, and add error handling to identify any build failures. Consider adding a RUN command to verify ponyc version and a simple Pony program compilation test before the final CMD instruction.
