current progress

The Dockerfile has been successfully created with all necessary system dependencies installed (OpenJDK 8, Ant, CMake, GCC/G++, GMP libraries, etc.). JAR dependencies are downloaded with fallback mechanisms. The Enhanced_Kodkod and Enumerator_Estimator build scripts are executed. Environment check and test runner scripts are created. The .gitignore file is updated with necessary entries. The build was successful and the container runs without errors.

next step

1. Add verification steps after each build to ensure successful compilation
2. Create the missing configuration files (paths.conf, build.properties)
3. Update the .classpath and .project files with proper path corrections
4. Add test execution commands to verify the built components work correctly
5. Create template files (.classpath.template, .project.template) for future use
6. Add commands to test the run.sh script with sample parameters
7. Verify the minisat executables can run with test inputs
8. Add integration test to run the complete pipeline from Alloy spec to results
