current progress
The Dockerfile has been created with Node.js 18 Alpine base image and necessary dependencies. The build failed during the yarn installation step with exit code 1, indicating issues with package installation.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to handle the yarn installation failure by: 1) Adding error handling and verbose logging to diagnose the issue, 2) Ensuring package files exist before attempting installation, 3) Using conditional installation with proper fallbacks: check if yarn.lock exists before using --frozen-lockfile, otherwise use npm install directly.
