current progress

Successfully set up the Docker environment with Python 3.9, Git, GitHub CLI, and created a virtual environment. Installed PyTorch CPU-only version, TabPFN package, all core dependencies (scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, einops, huggingface-hub, pydantic, pydantic-settings, python-dotenv, typing-extensions), test dependencies (pytest, pytest-xdist, psutil), and development dependencies (ruff, mypy, pre-commit, commitizen, type stubs, pyright, onnx). Created .env file with TabPFN settings, .gemini/config.yaml, and scripts/generate_dependencies.py. The environment is ready for generating dependency files and running tests.

next step

Add commands to the Dockerfile to generate the minimum and maximum requirement files using the created script, install pre-commit hooks, and create the tests directory structure with all the required test files (conftest.py, test_classifier.py, test_regressor.py, test_settings.py, test_config.py, etc.) as specified in the plan.
