I notice that the hardware information check encountered an API error rather than returning actual hardware specifications. Without concrete hardware details, I cannot make specific adjustments to the plan you mentioned.

However, since you haven't provided the current plan in your message (it appears to be missing after "This is our current plan:"), I cannot provide an adjusted version.

To properly assist you, I would need:
1. The actual current plan you want me to review
2. Valid hardware information including:
   - CPU architecture (x86_64, ARM, etc.)
   - Available RAM
   - Storage capacity
   - Operating system and version
   - Installed development tools and versions

Once you provide both the current plan and valid hardware information, I'll be able to create a properly adjusted plan that ensures compatibility with your system specifications.
