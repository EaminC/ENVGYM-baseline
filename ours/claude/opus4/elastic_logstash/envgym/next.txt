current progress
Successfully built a comprehensive development environment Docker image with Ubuntu 22.04 base, including multiple programming languages (Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP), database clients (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis), Docker/Docker Compose, and automatic dependency installation for various package managers. The build and runtime executed without errors.

next step
Optimize the Dockerfile by implementing multi-stage builds to reduce final image size, add specific version pinning for better reproducibility, include additional development tools (Rust, .NET Core, Kubernetes tools), implement proper error handling for dependency installations, add health checks, create non-root user for security, and consider splitting into language-specific base images for more targeted deployments.
