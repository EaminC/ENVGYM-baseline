current progress

The Dockerfile has successfully installed all system dependencies and created the conda environment structure. However, the conda environment creation failed at line 89 when trying to create the flex-env environment with Python 3.8. The error indicates that the conda create command did not complete successfully with exit code 1.

next step

Replace the conda environment creation approach by combining the environment creation with package installation in a single command, and add error handling. Specifically, modify lines 89-91 to use a more robust approach:
1. Remove the separate conda create command (line 89)
2. Create the environment and install Python in one step with better error handling
3. Use conda update conda before creating the environment to ensure compatibility
4. Consider using mamba as a faster alternative to conda for solving dependencies
