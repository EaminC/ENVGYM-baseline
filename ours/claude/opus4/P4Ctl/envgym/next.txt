current progress

The Dockerfile has been successfully created with all required components installed including Ubuntu 20.04 base, Python 3.7, build tools, Bison 3.8.2, Flex 2.6.4, BCC/eBPF tools, and the P4Control environment. The NetCL compiler has been built, docker-compose.yml has been generated for the three-host network setup, sample NetCL rules have been created, and all environment variables have been configured. The Docker image builds and runs successfully.

next step

The Dockerfile is complete and functional. The next major step is to download and install the Tofino SDE 9.7.0 (which requires manual download from Intel/Barefoot Networks due to licensing) and then proceed with testing the P4Control system components including P4 program compilation, switch controller connection, eBPF agent loading, and the complete DIFC traffic control functionality between the three Docker containers.
