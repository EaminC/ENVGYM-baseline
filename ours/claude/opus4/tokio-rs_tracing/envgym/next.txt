Add missing tools and dependencies:

2. Install Rust 1.65.0 toolchain (minimum version from CI matrix)
3. Add health check or verification commands to ensure all tools are properly installed
4. Consider adding a non-root user for security best practices
5. Add labels for better container documentation
