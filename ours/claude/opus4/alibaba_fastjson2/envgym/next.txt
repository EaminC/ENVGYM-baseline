current progress

The base Ubuntu 20.04 environment has been successfully set up with all required system dependencies, Java development tools (OpenJDK 8 & 11, Maven, Gradle, Ant), and the working directory has been created. The Dockerfile includes commands to clone the fastjson2 repository and cache Maven dependencies.

next step

Remove or modify the git clone command since the project files should be mounted as a volume rather than cloned during image build. Add a verification step to check Java and Maven installations, and consider adding a non-root user for better security practices. The mvn dependency:go-offline command should also be removed or moved to a runtime script since it depends on having the actual project files present.
