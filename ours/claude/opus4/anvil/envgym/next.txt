current progress

The Dockerfile build is failing at the Verus compilation step. The error indicates that the `--features unstable` flag is not recognized by the Verus build system. The build process has successfully:
- Set up Ubuntu 20.04 base image with all required system dependencies
- Installed Python 3 and tabulate module
- Installed Rust toolchains (1.88.0 and nightly-2024-05-01)
- Installed Go, kind, kubectl, and minikube
- Cloned Verus repository at the correct commit
- Downloaded and extracted Z3 theorem prover

next step

Remove the `--features unstable` flag from the Verus build command in line 73-75. The correct build command should be:
```
cargo +nightly-2024-05-01 build --release --verbose
```
According to the Verus repository structure, the `unstable` feature flag is not defined in the Verus Cargo.toml, which is why the build is failing.
