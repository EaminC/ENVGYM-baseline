current progress

Successfully built a multi-stage Dockerfile with Go 1.21.13 and essential tools installed. The build includes goctl v1.8.4-beta, protoc-gen-go, grpc tools, and various development utilities. The image is based on Alpine 3.19 with comprehensive tooling for database clients, monitoring tools, and container orchestration.

next step

Add missing tools to the Dockerfile: golangci-lint, act (GitHub Actions CLI), trivy (security scanner), and additional Go packages. Also need to create the required project files (.gitignore, greet.api, configuration files, go.mod) either through COPY commands or RUN commands in the Dockerfile to complete the environment setup.
