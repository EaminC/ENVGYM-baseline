current progress

The Dockerfile has been successfully created with all required dependencies installed including Ubuntu 20.04 base, Python 2.7 with pip2, OpenJDK 8, ANTLR 4.7.1, and all Python packages (TensorFlow 1.5.0, PyTorch 0.4.0, Pyro 0.2.1, Edward, PyStan, etc.). The build and runtime execution completed successfully. The Dockerfile sets up the working directory, copies files, creates output directory, downloads ANTLR jar, and sets executable permissions for scripts.

next step

Create and add the missing files to the project before copying to Docker image: check.py (verification script), language/antlr/run.sh (ANTLR execution script), install_java.sh (modified for OpenJDK 8), and ensure all template files exist in language/templates/ directory (simple.template, linearregression.template, mlr.template, cond.template). Also verify that stanmodels.json and config.json exist with proper structure before the COPY command in the Dockerfile.
