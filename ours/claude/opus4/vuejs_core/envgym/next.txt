current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Node.js 22.14.0, pnpm 10.15.0, and all required system dependencies for Puppeteer/Chromium. The image includes all necessary packages installed in chunks to handle the monorepo structure, with proper error handling for partial failures. The build completed successfully despite some warnings during the build and git hooks setup phases.

next step

1. Add missing development tools and VS Code extensions support by installing additional packages (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest CLI)
2. Create missing configuration files that are referenced but not present in the repository (tsconfig.build-browser.json, tsconfig.build-node.json, cspell.json)
3. Set up the scripts directory structure with all required build scripts (dev.js, build.js, release.js, etc.)
4. Configure the development environment for optimal use of 96 CPU cores by setting appropriate Node.js and build tool parallelization flags
5. Add health checks and verification commands to ensure all tools are properly installed and configured
