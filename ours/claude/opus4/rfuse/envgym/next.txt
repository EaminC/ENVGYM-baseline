current progress

The Dockerfile has been successfully created following the complete plan. It includes Ubuntu 20.04 base image, essential build tools, Python 3 environment setup, working directory configuration at /home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse, subdirectory creation, requirements.txt handling, development tools installation, and proper COPY/CMD instructions. The previous Docker execution log shows a successful build and runtime test.

next step

Test the Dockerfile by building the image with `docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t rfuse:latest .` and running a container with `docker run -it --platform=linux/amd64 -v $(pwd):/home/cc/EnvGym/data/rfuse --name rfuse-container rfuse:latest` to verify all components are properly installed and the environment is ready for RFuse development.
