current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Node.js 22, installed system dependencies including Git, build tools, X11 libraries for Electron, and Electron-specific dependencies. Cloned the Insomnia repository, set up environment variables, installed npm dependencies, and created basic configuration files (.editorconfig, .prettierrc, .vscode-settings.json). The container starts with Xvfb for headless Electron support.

next step

Create missing configuration files (.env, .gitignore if needed, .vscode/launch.json for debugging, playwright.config.js, vitest.config.js, .github/pull_request_template.md, docs/feature-proposal-template.md, .eslintrc.js, patches/ directory), verify the development environment by running tests (npm test, npm run test:smoke:dev), start the development server (npm run dev), and test the Inso CLI build process (npm run inso-start).
