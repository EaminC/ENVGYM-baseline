current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Ubuntu 22.04 base, installed all required JDKs (11, 17, 21), Android SDK, GraalVM 21, Kotlin 2.0.20, Groovy 3.0.22, GitHub CLI, and other tools. Cloned Mockito repository, set up Android SDK properties, configured Java 21 as default, verified Gradle wrapper works, and attempted to download mockito-core dependencies.

next step

Update Kotlin compiler from 2.0.20 to 2.2.0 as specified in the plan, and update Groovy from 3.0.22 to 3.0.25 to match the exact versions required. Add verification steps to check all tools are properly installed and accessible. Consider adding a final build verification step to ensure the environment can successfully compile the Mockito project.
