current progress

Successfully built Ubuntu 20.04 Docker image with Rust 1.77.2 toolchain, essential build tools (git, make, gcc, cross-compilation toolchains), and development dependencies installed. The image includes rustfmt, clippy, cross, and cargo-audit tools. The fd project builds successfully with `cargo build --release --locked` and shell completions are generated. Basic configuration files for fd (~/.config/fd/ignore) and FZF integration environment variables are set up in the container.

next step

Add test execution and verification steps to the Dockerfile to ensure the built fd binary works correctly and passes the test suite. This includes running `cargo test --release --locked`, `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and verifying the fd binary can execute basic commands. Also add installation steps using the Makefile's install target to test the complete installation process, and create test cases to verify core functionality like pattern matching, file type filtering, and ignore file handling.
