current progress

The Dockerfile successfully builds an Ubuntu 22.04 environment with Git, Micromamba, and the Baleen-FAST24 repository cloned with submodules. It creates all required directory structures, sets up gitignore files, installs Micromamba and creates the cachelib-py-3.11 environment with dependencies from the yaml/requirements files, installs JupyterLab, and prepares scripts for downloading trace files. The build and runtime execution completed successfully.

next step

Add the trace file download execution, ML model training step, and simulation runs to the Dockerfile. Specifically: 1) Run the download_traces.sh script during build to fetch the trace files, 2) Add commands to train the Baleen ML models using BCacheSim.episodic_analysis.train, 3) Add RejectX and Baleen simulation runs using BCacheSim.cachesim.simulate_ap with the example configs, 4) Verify the outputs are created in the expected directories (tmp/ for models, runs/ for results).
