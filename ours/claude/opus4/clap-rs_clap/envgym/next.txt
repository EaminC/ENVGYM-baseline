current progress

The Docker environment has been successfully set up with Ubuntu 22.04 base image, Rust 1.89.0 toolchain, all required development tools (cargo extensions, Node.js, shells, etc.), and the project builds successfully. The environment includes all necessary components from the plan: Rust with wasm targets, cargo tools, shell environments for testing, Node.js for Renovate, Python for pre-commit, and specialized binaries like elvish and nushell.

next step

Create all the required project files as specified in the plan's "FILES TO CREATE" section, starting with the workspace Cargo.toml and the individual crate manifests, then proceeding with documentation files (README.md, LICENSE files, CONTRIBUTING.md), configuration files (.gitignore, rustfmt.toml, .clippy.toml), GitHub workflow files, and example/test directories. The Dockerfile should be modified to COPY these files after creation rather than copying everything with "COPY . ."
