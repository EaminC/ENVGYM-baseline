current progress
Successfully built a Docker image with Node.js 22 Alpine base, installed all dependencies including git, python3, and build tools. Created all required configuration files (.env, .env.example, jest configs, express.js, .prettierrc, .eslintrc.js, .gitignore, docker-compose.yml). Installed npm packages, Express.js, and Vercel CLI. Set up basic environment with placeholder GitHub token and exposed port 3000.

next step
Replace placeholder GitHub token in .env file with actual PAT_1 token, add health check to verify API endpoints are accessible, run test suites (npm test, npm run test:e2e, npm run bench) to validate setup, and change CMD to start the Express server (CMD ["node", "express.js"]) instead of bash shell for production readiness.
