current progress

Successfully built a Rust development environment Docker image with:
- Rust 1.80 toolchain with multiple targets (wasm32, i686)
- All required system libraries for graphics and development
- Essential cargo tools installed (wasm-pack, cargo-workspaces, etc.)
- Repository cloned from GitHub
- Basic cargo configuration set up
- Build completed without errors

next step

1. Add missing tools: act (for local GitHub Actions testing) and wasm_sync crate
2. Create the required directory structure and files as specified in the plan
3. Set up the workspace Cargo.toml configuration
4. Configure the build environment for the specific rayon-rs project structure
5. Add commands to prepare benchmark data directories and download scripts
