current progress

The Docker environment has been successfully built and can run. The Dockerfile includes all necessary system dependencies (git, git-lfs, wget), clones the SixthSense repository, creates required directories, installs Python dependencies, attempts to download CSV files from Zenodo (with error handling), creates placeholder subcategories JSON files, configures matplotlib for headless operation, and sets up Git LFS tracking.

next step

Test the actual functionality of the SixthSense application within the Docker container by running the train.py script with test parameters to verify that all components work correctly together, and check if the CSV files were successfully downloaded or if manual intervention is needed for the Zenodo downloads.
