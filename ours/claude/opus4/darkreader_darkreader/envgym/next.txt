current progress

Successfully created a Docker environment for Dark Reader development with Node.js 18, Git, build tools, Chrome, Firefox, and all necessary system dependencies installed. The repository has been cloned, dependencies installed via npm, and both debug and release builds completed successfully. The container provides an interactive shell with helpful command documentation for development tasks.

next step

Add test execution verification to the Dockerfile by running the test suites after the build step to ensure the testing environment is properly configured. Add the following commands after the build step: `RUN npm run test:unit` to verify unit tests work, and create test HTML files to verify the API functionality. Also add `RUN npm run lint` to ensure code style checking is functional. This will validate that the development environment is fully operational for both building and testing.
