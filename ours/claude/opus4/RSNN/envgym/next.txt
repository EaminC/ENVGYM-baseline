current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Ubuntu 20.04 base, installed all system dependencies (ffmpeg, HDF5, build tools), Python 3.10.12, created the complete directory structure, installed PyTorch CPU version and all Python dependencies from requirements.txt, created configuration directories, set up environment variables in .env file, installed development dependencies, and configured PYTHONPATH. The build completed without errors.

next step

Add verification commands to the Dockerfile to test the installation: 1) Add RUN commands to verify Python imports (torch, numpy, hydra, etc.), 2) Create placeholder configuration files if they don't exist (conf/defaults.yaml, conf/evaluate.yaml, conf/data/data-default.yaml, conf/train-bigRSNN.yaml, conf/train-tinyRSNN.yaml), 3) Add a test script that validates the environment setup by checking if all required modules can be imported and configuration files can be loaded, 4) Consider adding HEALTHCHECK or validation steps to ensure the container is properly configured for the RSNN project.
