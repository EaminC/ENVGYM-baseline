current progress

The base Docker environment has been successfully built with Ubuntu 20.04, essential build tools (gcc, g++, cmake, make), Python 3 environment, and the working directory structure for CrossPrefetch. The container runs successfully and provides a basic development environment.

next step

Add CrossPrefetch-specific dependencies and source code to the Dockerfile. This includes cloning the CrossPrefetch repository (if available), installing any required libraries or dependencies specific to the prefetching system, and setting up the compilation environment for the CrossPrefetch codebase.
