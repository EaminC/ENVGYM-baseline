current progress

Successfully built Docker image with Python 3.7, installed all required packages (TensorFlow 2.5.0, Z3, AIF360, etc.), created virtual environment, set up all directory structures including res/ directories with readme.md files, made shell scripts executable, and updated .gitignore with all required patterns. The container builds and runs successfully with proper entrypoint configuration.

next step

Create configuration files (.env, config.py, solver_config.py), test scripts (test_environment.py, test_data_loading.py, etc.), and documentation files (ARTIFACT_EVALUATION.md, LICENSE_NOTICE.md, requirements_verified.txt) by adding COPY commands or RUN commands to generate these files in the Dockerfile.
