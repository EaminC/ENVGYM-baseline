current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Python 3.8, PyTorch 2.0.0 CPU version, PyTorch Geometric 2.3.1 and all CPU-compatible dependencies, created necessary directory structure, set CPU-only environment variables, and generated environment snapshot.

next step

Add creation of configuration files for all model types (GCN, GAT, GIN, SAGE) and datasets (Cora, Amazon Computers, Amazon Photo, ArXiv, Coauthor CS, Products) in the appropriate config directories, and verify the main.py file exists and is executable.
