current progress

The Dockerfile has been successfully created and tested. It includes a base Ubuntu 20.04 image with essential development tools (build-essential, curl, wget, git, vim), Python 3 with pip, and conditional installation of Python dependencies from requirements.txt and system dependencies from apt-requirements.txt. The working directory is set to /home/cc/EnvGym/data/exli, and the build was successful according to the execution log.

next step

Analyze the project files in /home/cc/EnvGym/data/exli to identify specific dependencies and runtime requirements. Add project-specific installations such as additional programming languages, frameworks, or libraries. Configure any necessary environment variables, ports, or services based on the project's needs. Test the container with actual project code to ensure all dependencies are properly installed and the application runs correctly.
