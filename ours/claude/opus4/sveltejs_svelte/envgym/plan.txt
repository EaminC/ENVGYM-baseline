Based on the hardware information provided, here's the complete adjusted plan for the Svelte.js project:

## Environment Setup Plan for Svelte.js Project

### Base Environment
- **Base Image**: `node:alpine` (optimized for x86_64 architecture)
- **Working Directory**: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data/sveltejs_svelte`
- **Platform**: `linux/amd64`

### System Requirements
- **Architecture**: x86_64 compatible
- **GPU**: Not required (no CUDA support needed)
- **Docker**: Version 28.1.1 with BuildKit support

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Node.js Environment**
   - Use Node.js Alpine image for minimal footprint
   - Install npm/yarn package manager
   - Set up proper working directory permissions

2. **Svelte.js Dependencies**
   - Install Svelte compiler and runtime
   - Configure build tools (Rollup/Vite/Webpack as per project)
   - Install development dependencies

3. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sveltejs_svelte/
   ├── src/
   ├── public/
   ├── node_modules/
   ├── package.json
   └── [other project files]
   ```

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Configure for x86_64 architecture
   - No GPU-specific optimizations needed
   - Use standard Node.js build processes

5. **Development Tools**
   - Text editor/IDE support
   - Hot module replacement for development
   - Build optimization for production

### Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data/sveltejs_svelte
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### Resource Allocation
- **CPU**: Standard x86_64 processing
- **Memory**: Allocate based on project size (typically 1-2GB for development)
- **Storage**: Ensure adequate space for node_modules and build artifacts

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV`: development/production
- `PORT`: 5000 (or as configured)
- Project-specific environment variables as needed

This plan is fully compatible with the x86_64 architecture and doesn't require any GPU-specific configurations.
