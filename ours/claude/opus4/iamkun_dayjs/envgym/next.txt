current progress

Successfully set up Node.js 18 environment with all required system dependencies (git, build-essential, Java). Cloned Day.js repository and installed npm dependencies. Created all essential configuration files (.eslintrc.js, .prettierrc, .gitignore, .npmrc, .editorconfig, babel.config.js, rollup.config.js, karma.conf.js, .size-limit.json) and GitHub Actions workflow. Attempted initial build steps (prettier, lint, babel, build) and created development branch.

next step

Add verification steps to check build outputs and run the test suite. Specifically: verify dayjs.min.js was created and check its size, verify ESM build in esm/ directory exists, run npm test to execute the full test suite, run npm run test-tz for timezone-specific tests, and run npm run size to verify bundle size stays under 2.99 KB limit. Also need to create index.d.ts TypeScript declaration file and verify it compiles correctly.
