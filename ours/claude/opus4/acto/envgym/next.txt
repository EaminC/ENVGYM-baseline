current progress

Successfully built a Docker image with Ubuntu 20.04 base that includes all required system packages (Python 3.10, Go 1.21.5, Docker tools, Kubernetes tools), cloned the Acto repository, set up Python virtual environment with all required packages, installed Ansible collections, created necessary directory structure, and attempted to build Go shared libraries. The container builds and runs successfully.

next step

Add verification steps to check if the Go shared libraries were built successfully, add error handling for the build steps, verify Python environment activation, and add a health check script to validate all components are properly installed and configured. Consider adding environment variables for configuration paths and adding a non-root user for better security practices.
