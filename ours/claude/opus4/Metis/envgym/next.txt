current progress

The Dockerfile has been successfully created with Ubuntu 20.04 as the base image and includes most of the required system packages and dependencies listed in the plan. The build was successful and the container runs without errors. Key components installed include: build tools (gcc, g++, make, cmake), kernel development packages, various filesystem utilities (xfs, f2fs, jfs, btrfs, nilfs), NFS-related packages, Python 3 with required packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, PuLP, ply), and debugging/profiling tools.

next step

1. Add installation of specific kernel versions and kernel source code downloads
2. Clone and build the required GitHub repositories (fsl-spin, swarm-mcfs, RefFS, IOCov, Metis-Replayer, NFS-Ganesha, xxHash, zlib, eXplode)
3. Create necessary directories structure (/home/cc/EnvGym/data/, /mnt/test-*, /profiling/)
4. Build and install modified brd kernel modules for different kernel versions
5. Set up SSH keys and configuration for master-client communication
6. Create required configuration files and scripts as specified in the plan
