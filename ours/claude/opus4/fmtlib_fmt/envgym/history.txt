NEXT:
  current progress
  The Dockerfile has been created with Ubuntu 22.04 base image and most required tools installed including:
  - Build essentials (GCC 11, Clang 14, make, ninja)
  - CMake 3.28.1 and Bazelisk for Bazel 8.1.1
  - Python 3 and pip
  - Android SDK/NDK setup
  - Development tools (git, gdb, valgrind, clang-format, etc.)
  - Directory structure creation
  - Basic configuration files (.bazelversion, .cpplint.cfg)
  The build failed at pip install step due to pymdownx package not being found.
  next step
  Fix the pip install command by replacing 'pymdownx' with 'pymdown-extensions' (the correct package name) in the Dockerfile at lines 61-67. The corrected RUN command should be:
  ```
  RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir \
      mkdocs \
      mkdocs-material \
      mkdocstrings[python-legacy] \
      pymdown-extensions \
      mike \
      cpplint
  ```

  current progress
  The Docker environment has been successfully set up with all major dependencies installed including:
  - Build tools (GCC 11, Clang 14, CMake 3.28.1, Bazel via Bazelisk)
  - Development tools (Git, Python 3, pip, pkg-config, ninja-build, gdb, valgrind, kcov)
  - Code quality tools (clang-format, clang-tidy, cpplint, doxygen)
  - Android development tools (SDK, NDK 21.3.6528147, Gradle 7.6)
  - Documentation tools (MkDocs, mkdocs-material, mkdocstrings)
  - Virtualization tools (Vagrant, VirtualBox)
  - Basic directory structure created with placeholders
  - Bazel configuration files copied to root
  - cpplint configuration created
  next step
  Create the core header files and implementation files for the fmt library:
  1. Create include/fmt/base.h with version information and core macros
  2. Create include/fmt/core.h with basic formatting functionality
  3. Create include/fmt/format.h as the main format header
  4. Create include/fmt/format-inl.h for inline implementations
  5. Create src/format.cc as the main implementation file
  6. Create a basic CMakeLists.txt in the root directory for CMake build configuration
  7. Create test/test-main.cc for the main test runner
  8. Create test/format-test.cc with basic formatting tests

If your application stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.
  #13 2.231 
  #13 2.231 4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
  #13 2.231 
  #13 2.231 4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

  #13 2.231 5. Your Developer Credentials
  #13 2.231

  #13 2.231 7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third party applications, data, content, or resources.
  #13 2.231 
  #13 2.231 7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant owners.
  #13 2.231 
  #13 2.231 7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.

  #13 2.231 
  #13 2.231 8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.

  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10. GENERAL.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS? rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient?s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS? express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is "deemed" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 ANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS? AND ?AS AVAILABLE?, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
  #13 2.236 
  #13 2.236 10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.
