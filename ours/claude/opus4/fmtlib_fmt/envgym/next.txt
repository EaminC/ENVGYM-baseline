next step

Create the core header files and implementation files for the fmt library:
1. Create include/fmt/base.h with version information and core macros
2. Create include/fmt/core.h with basic formatting functionality
3. Create include/fmt/format.h as the main format header
4. Create include/fmt/format-inl.h for inline implementations
5. Create src/format.cc as the main implementation file
6. Create a basic CMakeLists.txt in the root directory for CMake build configuration
7. Create test/test-main.cc for the main test runner
8. Create test/format-test.cc with basic formatting tests
