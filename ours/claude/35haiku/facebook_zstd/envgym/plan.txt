=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - GCC (version 14.2.0 or compatible for x86_64)
   - Make/Gmake (native to Ubuntu/Debian)
   - CMake (version 3.14 or higher, x86_64 compatible)
   - Ninja build system
   - Meson build system (x86_64 version)
   - Python3 (system Python for x86_64)
   - Python3 development tools
   - Build-essential packages for Ubuntu/Debian
   - Docker BuildKit compatible tools
   - Alpine Linux base image (verified for x86_64)
   - Development packages matching x86_64 architecture
   - Google Test (gtest) library
   - zlib (x86_64 native support)
   - lzma libraries
   - lz4 libraries

2. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
   - Optimize build configurations for x86_64
   - Leverage large 187.5GB memory for:
     * Multi-stage Docker builds
     * Parallel compilation
     * Comprehensive testing
   - Remove ARM-specific toolchains
   - Focus on Linux/x86_64 native builds
   - Adjust paths to /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/facebook_zstd
   - Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base image

3. BUILD STRATEGY:
   - Prioritize CPU-based compilation
   - Use Docker 28.3.2 with BuildKit
   - Enable multi-stage builds
   - Optimize for large memory environment
   - Create lightweight, modular build configurations

4. TESTING CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Focus on x86_64 native testing
   - Leverage large memory for extensive test suites
   - Parallel test execution
   - Comprehensive CPU-based performance testing

5. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Use multi-stage Dockerfile
   - Optimize layer caching
   - Minimize image size
   - Ensure compatibility with x86_64 architecture

6. TOOLCHAIN ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Remove iOS/macOS specific tools
   - Focus on Linux x86_64 toolchains
   - Verify GCC and Clang compatibility
   - Ensure cross-compilation support if needed

7. STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE:
   - Utilize large memory for in-memory builds
   - Create efficient build caching mechanisms
   - Optimize disk I/O for compilation
   - Implement incremental build strategies

Remaining sections of the original plan remain largely unchanged, with architecture-specific optimizations applied.
