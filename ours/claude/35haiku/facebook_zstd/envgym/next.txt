current progress
Dockerfile is configured for x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 environment with comprehensive build dependencies. Previous build attempt failed during CMake configuration and build stage. Current setup includes multi-stage build, dependency installation, and environment preparation for zstd project compilation.

next step
Modify CMake build configuration to resolve compilation errors, specifically:
1. Adjust parallel build setting from --parallel 1 to match system core count
2. Review and potentially modify CMake flags to reduce warning suppressions
3. Add explicit error handling or logging to capture specific build failure points
4. Consider adding verbose error reporting mechanisms in the build process
