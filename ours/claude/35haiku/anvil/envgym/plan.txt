Here's the adjusted environment setup plan based on the hardware information:

=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust (version 1.88.0, edition 2021) [x86_64 compatible]
   - Verus (version: release/0.2025.07.05.8bd7c32, specific commit: 3b6b805ac86cd6640d59468341055c7fa14cff07)
   - Cargo (Rust package manager)
   - Git
   - kube-rs library
   - k8s-openapi library
   - SMT solver (Z3 recommended)
   - Kubernetes development environment (kind, version 0.23.0)
   - Docker (version 28.3.2)
   - Go (version: ^1.20)
   - bash (for shell scripts)
   - cargo-verify
   - cargo-watch
   - kubectl
   - OpenSSL (for certificate generation)
   - tungstenite (WebSocket library, version 0.20.1)
   - rand (random number generation library, version 0.8)
   - Verus builtin and vstd libraries
   - Python3
   - Python3-pip
   - tabulate (Python library)

2. HARDWARE-OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86_64)
   - Multi-stage Docker builds to minimize layer size
   - Optimize for large memory (187.5GB)
   - Use BuildKit features for efficient builds
   - Ensure x86_64 architecture compatibility
   - No CUDA/GPU-specific configurations

3. DOCKER AND BUILD OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Use `--platform linux/amd64` in Docker builds
   - Implement multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles
   - Minimize intermediate layers
   - Use Alpine Linux as base image for slim builds where possible
   - Leverage BuildKit cache mounting
   - Implement aggressive layer caching

4. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Working Directory: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/anvil`
   - Ensure all paths are relative to this directory
   - Create symlinks if necessary for tool accessibility
   - Configure environment variables for consistent toolchain

5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Utilize large memory for parallel builds
   - Configure Rust and Cargo for parallel compilation
   - Optimize Docker build caching
   - Use RAM-based temporary storage for builds
   - Implement efficient dependency management

6. TOOLCHAIN COMPATIBILITY:
   - Verify x86_64 compatibility for all tools
   - Test cross-compilation if needed
   - Ensure consistent library and dependency versions
   - Create comprehensive version lockfile

7. SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE:
   - Use official Docker images
   - Implement minimal permission principles
   - Regular dependency and security scanning
   - Use trusted base images (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)

8. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Create comprehensive documentation for setup
   - Develop reproducible setup scripts
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for environment validation
   - Create fallback and recovery mechanisms

Key Adjustments:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Leveraged large memory capabilities
- Minimized Docker image sizes
- Ensured compatibility with Docker 28.3.2
- Focused on efficient, reproducible builds
- Removed GPU-specific configurations
- Emphasized multi-stage, lean builds

Verification Method:
- Test builds on x86_64 architecture
- Validate Docker image sizes
- Confirm performance with large memory
- Test cross-tool compatibility
- Verify build reproducibility
