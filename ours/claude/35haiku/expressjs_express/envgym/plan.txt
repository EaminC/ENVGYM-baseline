=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Node.js (Version 18 LTS, optimized for x86_64 architecture)
   - npm (Latest version compatible with Node.js 18)
   - Git (Latest stable version for x86_64)
   - Express.js (Version 5.1.0)
   - Code editor (VS Code recommended, x86_64 version)
   - Base Image: node:alpine or node:slim (optimized for x86_64)

2. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Use multi-stage build
   - Minimize Docker image layers
   - Create .dockerignore file
   - Platform specification: --platform linux/amd64
   - Base image selection: node:alpine (lightweight, x86_64 compatible)

3. FILES TO CREATE:
   [Unchanged from original plan, with additional:]
   - Dockerfile
   - .dockerignore

4. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Leverage BuildKit features
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Minimal image size (Alpine-based)
   - Ensure compatibility with Docker 28.3.2

5. STORAGE AND MEMORY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Estimated project footprint: <500MB
   - Recommended minimum RAM: 4GB
   - Use volume mounting for persistent data
   - Implement efficient file management in examples

6. PATH ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/expressjs_express
   - Ensure consistent path references
   - Use relative path configurations

7. PERFORMANCE TUNING:
   - Node.js runtime optimization
   - Minimal dependency footprint
   - Efficient package management
   - Leverage npm caching
   - Implement lightweight middleware

8. COMPATIBILITY CHECKS:
   - Verify x86_64 package compatibility
   - Test on multiple Linux distributions
   - Ensure cross-platform functionality
   - Validate Docker image portability

9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use non-root user in Docker container
   - Implement least privilege principles
   - Minimize exposed ports
   - Use Alpine's built-in security features

Verification Method:
- Docker build validation
- Architecture compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Security scan of Docker image
- Comprehensive example testing
- Cross-platform compatibility checks
