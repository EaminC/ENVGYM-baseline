=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - CMake (version 3.11+ for x86_64 architecture)
   - Meson build system (version compatible with x86_64)
   - Bazel build system (version 6.0+ for x86_64)
   - C++ Compiler:
     * GCC 9+ (recommended for x86_64)
     * Clang 10+ 
   - Git (latest version compatible with x86_64)
   - Docker BuildX for multi-stage builds
   - Header-only JSON libraries:
     * nlohmann/json (version 3.12.0)
     * Optimized for x86_64 architecture

2. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: ubuntu:22.04 
   - Platform: linux/amd64
   - Recommended Docker Multi-Stage Build Strategy
   - Leverage 187GB available memory
   - Minimize image layer size
   - Use BuildKit features for efficient builds

3. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Toolchain Optimization:
     * GCC/Clang with x86_64 native optimizations
     * Use -march=native compilation flags
     * Leverage large memory for parallel compilation
   - Build System Configuration:
     * CMake with x86_64 optimizations
     * Meson build configuration for performance
     * Bazel build rules optimized for x86_64

4. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Use pkg-config for package management
   - Leverage Docker multi-stage builds
   - Minimize external dependencies
   - Optimize package installation for x86_64

5. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Focus on x86_64 architecture compatibility
   - Comprehensive build system tests
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Memory usage optimization tests
   - Cross-compilation compatibility checks

6. RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
   - Valgrind (memory profiling)
   - Clang Static Analyzer
   - Google Benchmark
   - Docker BuildX
   - CI/CD pipeline optimization tools

7. STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Utilize large memory (187GB) for:
     * Parallel compilation
     * Extensive testing
     * Caching build artifacts
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Use tmpfs for temporary build directories

8. DOCKERFILE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Multi-stage build approach
   - Minimal base image (ubuntu:22.04)
   - Layer caching optimization
   - Reduced image size
   - Efficient dependency management

9. PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY:
   - Primary focus: x86_64 Linux environments
   - Docker container portability
   - Consistent build environments
   - Reproducible build process

10. ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION:
    - Use /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/nlohmann_json as primary working directory
    - Implement robust error handling
    - Comprehensive logging
    - Performance monitoring

Key Adjustments:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Leveraged large memory capabilities
- Docker BuildX multi-stage build strategy
- Minimized external dependencies
- Performance and compatibility focus

Verification Method:
- Comprehensive architectural compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory usage profiling
- Build system validation across x86_64 environments
