current progress
Successfully created a Docker environment for x86_64 architecture with optimized build tools, including CMake, Bazel, Meson, GCC 9, Clang, and nlohmann/json library. The Dockerfile implements most of the original plan's key requirements for system configuration, toolchain optimization, and dependency management.

next step
Enhance Dockerfile by adding:
1. Docker BuildX multi-stage build implementation
2. Additional performance testing tools (Google Benchmark)
3. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms
4. Configure tmpfs for temporary build directories
5. Add cross-compilation compatibility checks
