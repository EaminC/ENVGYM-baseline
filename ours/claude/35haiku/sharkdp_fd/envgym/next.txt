current progress
Successfully configured a multi-stage Docker build for x86_64 architecture, installed Rust toolchain, added cross-compilation targets, and built the project with release configuration. Base image is Ubuntu 22.04, with core dependencies and Rust environment established.

next step
Optimize Docker image size by using Alpine or Debian slim base image, implement BuildKit cache mounts, add security scanning, configure explicit performance optimization flags for Rust compilation, and validate multi-stage build efficiency.
