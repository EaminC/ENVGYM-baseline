=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust programming language (version 1.64 minimum, recommended 1.77.2 for x86_64)
   - Cargo (Rust's package manager)
   - make
   - git
   - rustfmt (for code formatting)
   - Cross-compilation targets:
     * x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (primary target)
     * x86_64-unknown-linux-musl (for slim builds)

2. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
   - Leverage large memory (187.5GB) for:
     * Parallel compilation
     * Comprehensive testing
     * Caching build artifacts
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Prefer slim/alpine-based images for smaller footprint

3. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - Dockerfile Recommendations:
     * Base image: ubuntu:22.04-slim or debian:bullseye-slim
     * Use multi-stage builds
     * Implement BuildKit cache mounts
     * Set explicit platform: linux/amd64

4. DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES:
   - Prioritize x86_64 native packages
   - Install development tools:
     * build-essential
     * pkg-config
     * libssl-dev
   - Rust toolchain configuration:
     * Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
     * Default profile: release
     * Use rustup for toolchain management

5. BUILD AND TEST STRATEGY:
   - Leverage large memory for:
     * Parallel test execution
     * Comprehensive cross-compilation tests
     * Performance benchmarking
   - Optimization flags:
     * -C target-cpu=native
     * -C lto=thin
     * Enable CPU-specific optimizations

6. CROSS-COMPILATION ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Focus on x86_64 targets
   - Remove ARM-specific configurations
   - Validate x86_64 GNU and MUSL builds

7. DOCKER BUILD CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use Docker 28.3.2 BuildKit features
   - Implement multi-stage builds
   - Use cache mounts for dependency management
   - Minimize image size with slim variants

8. PATHS AND DIRECTORIES:
   - Confirm working directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sharkdp_fd
   - Use consistent, absolute paths
   - Ensure compatibility with Ubuntu/Debian filesystem hierarchy

9. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Utilize full RAM for:
     * Compilation caching
     * Parallel build processes
     * Comprehensive testing
   - Configure Cargo for optimal x86_64 performance
   - Enable link-time optimization (LTO)

10. SECURITY AND COMPATIBILITY:
    - Use official Rust images as base
    - Implement comprehensive security scanning
    - Validate package integrity
    - Ensure compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ecosystem

The rest of the original plan remains largely unchanged, with focus on x86_64 architecture, leveraging large memory, and using multi-stage Docker builds with slim images.
