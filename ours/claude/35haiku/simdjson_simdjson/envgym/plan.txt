=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - C++ Compiler: GCC 10-11 or Clang 11-12 (x86_64 compatible)
   - CMake (version 3.20+, optimized for Ubuntu 22.04)
   - Git
   - Doxygen
   - Wget and Curl
   - Ubuntu/Debian package management tools
   - Build-essential tools
   - Python3.10+
   - Bash shell
   - Docker CE (compatible with v28.3.2)
   - Docker BuildKit tools
   - Ninja build system
   - Linux performance tools (perf, valgrind)
   - Rust compiler (latest stable version)
   - Development libraries:
     * libcurl4-openssl-dev
     * zlib1g-dev
     * ca-certificates

   JSON Parsing Libraries (x86_64 optimized):
   - cJSON
   - RapidJSON
   - nlohmann/json
   - simdjson (added for x86_64 SIMD optimization)
   - fastjson
   - yyjson

   Benchmarking & Tools:
   - Google Benchmark (v1.9.4)
   - cxxopts
   - CPM.cmake for package management

2. CONFIGURATION ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/simdjson_simdjson
   - Base Image: ubuntu:22.04
   - Dockerfile Optimization:
     * Multi-stage builds
     * Layer caching strategies
     * x86_64 specific compilation flags
     * Large memory (187.5GB) build configuration

3. BUILD STRATEGY:
   - Use BuildKit for efficient multi-platform builds
   - Leverage x86_64 instruction set optimizations
   - Implement caching mechanisms for dependency downloads
   - Create modular, layered Docker build process
   - Optimize for large memory environment

4. TEST CONFIGURATION:
   - Focus on x86_64 architecture compatibility
   - Comprehensive JSON library performance testing
   - Cross-compiler validation (GCC, Clang)
   - SIMD optimization verification
   - Memory-intensive benchmark scenarios

5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Utilize full 187.5GB RAM for compilation and testing
   - Implement parallel build processes
   - Configure compiler optimization levels (-O2, -O3)
   - SIMD and vectorization support validation

6. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Use CPM.cmake for streamlined dependency handling
   - Create reproducible build environments
   - Implement version pinning for critical libraries
   - Develop robust download and verification scripts

7. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Use multi-stage builds
   - Implement .dockerignore
   - Create slim, optimized final images
   - Support potential future cross-platform builds

Verification Method: Comprehensive x86_64 Linux environment validation with emphasis on performance, library compatibility, and efficient build processes, leveraging the available large memory and modern development tools.
