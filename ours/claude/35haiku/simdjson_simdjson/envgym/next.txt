current progress
Dockerfile successfully configured with Ubuntu 22.04 base, installed core development tools, JSON libraries, Google Benchmark, and cloned simdjson repository. Build and runtime logs indicate successful execution. Environment meets most specified requirements with x86_64 architecture optimizations.

next step
Enhance Dockerfile by adding remaining JSON parsing libraries (cJSON, nlohmann/json, fastjson, yyjson), implement CPM.cmake for dependency management, configure explicit SIMD optimization flags, and add comprehensive performance testing scripts to validate x86_64 instruction set compatibility.
