current progress
Docker build failed during npm ci step, likely due to missing package.json or incorrect dependency configuration, preventing successful dependency installation and project build

next step
Verify package.json exists in project root, ensure all dependencies are correctly specified, check npm version compatibility with project, and add npm cache clean and error logging to dockerfile for more diagnostic information
