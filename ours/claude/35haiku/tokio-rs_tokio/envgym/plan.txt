=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust Programming Language (rustc & cargo)
     * Version: 1.70 or higher (confirmed x86_64 compatibility)
     * Nightly version support for documentation
     * Specific nightly version: nightly-2025-01-25
     * Download from: https://rustup.rs/
   - Git (for version control)
     * Latest stable version compatible with x86_64
   - Visual Studio Code or Rust-compatible IDE
   - Docker Configuration
     * Base Image: rust:slim-bullseye (optimized for x86_64)
     * Platform: linux/amd64
     * Multi-stage build support
     * Use .dockerignore for optimization
   - Development Tools
     * Standard x86_64 Linux development packages
     * Build-essential
     * pkg-config
     * libssl-dev

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Minimum RAM: 8GB (recommended for Rust compilation)
   - Storage: 20GB free space
   - CPU: x86_64 architecture optimization
   - Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Debian-based Linux

3. TOOLCHAIN CONFIGURATION:
   - Rust Toolchain
     * Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
     * Use rustup for multi-toolchain management
     * Configure nightly and stable channels
   - Cross-Compilation
     * Limit to x86_64 and compatible architectures
     * Remove FreeBSD 32-bit support
     * Focus on 64-bit Linux and compatible platforms

4. DOCKER OPTIMIZATION:
   - Dockerfile Recommendations:
     * Use rust:slim-bullseye as base image
     * Implement multi-stage build
     * Minimize layer count
     * Use BuildKit features
     * Optimize caching strategies
   - Container Configuration
     * Platform: linux/amd64
     * No GPU-specific configurations needed

5. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/tokio-rs_tokio
   - Path Configurations
     * Ensure consistent path handling
     * Use absolute paths in configurations
     * Set up proper volume mounting for Docker

6. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Keep all previously listed dependencies
   - Prioritize x86_64 compatible versions
   - Remove architecture-specific dependencies
   - Validate package compatibility with x86_64

7. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use cargo build --release for optimized builds
   - Enable LTO (Link Time Optimization)
   - Configure CPU-specific optimizations
   - Leverage x86_64 instruction set features

8. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Focus on x86_64 Linux testing
   - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Implement comprehensive test matrix
   - Validate cross-platform compatibility

9. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Generate documentation for x86_64 platform
   - Use rustdoc with nightly toolchain
   - Ensure cross-platform documentation generation

10. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - Use cargo-audit for security checks
    - Implement comprehensive error handling
    - Create detailed documentation
    - Use semantic versioning

Compatibility Summary:
- Primary Platform: x86_64 Linux
- Recommended Base Image: rust:slim-bullseye
- Docker Support: Full compatibility
- Architecture Optimization: x86_64
- Minimal External Dependencies
- Streamlined Build Process

The plan maintains the original comprehensive approach while optimizing for the specific x86_64 Linux environment, ensuring efficient development, testing, and deployment strategies.
