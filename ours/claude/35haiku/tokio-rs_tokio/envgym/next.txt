current progress
Docker setup successfully configured for x86_64 Linux environment with Rust 1.70, multi-stage build implemented, system dependencies installed, and initial build process established. Previous Docker execution was successful with no reported errors.

next step
Optimize multi-stage build by reducing layer count, implement more aggressive caching strategies, add explicit error handling in build process, and include explicit volume mounting configuration for improved development workflow.
