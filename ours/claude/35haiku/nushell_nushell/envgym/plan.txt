=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust (version 1.87.0, verified for x86_64 architecture)
   - Rustup (for managing Rust toolchain on x86_64)
   - GitHub Actions runner dependencies (optimized for 96-core system)
   - Cross-platform CI/CD tools
   - Additional CI/CD requirements:
     * Actions Checkout (v5)
     * Actions Rust Toolchain Setup (v1.12.0)
     * Python 3.10 (64-bit)
     * Virtualenv
   - WebAssembly (wasm32-unknown-unknown target)
   - Platform-specific GitHub Actions runners:
     * Ubuntu 22.04 (matching base system)
     * macOS 13
     * Windows Latest
   - Additional build and testing tools:
     * cargo fmt
     * cargo clippy
     * cargo test
   - Development environment requirements:
     * Git
     * Bash
     * PowerShell
     * Python pip

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - GitHub Actions workflow configuration: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
     * Optimize for 96-core parallel processing
     * Adjust resource allocation settings
   - CI/CD specific configuration files:
     * `clippy/wasm/config.toml`
     * MSRV verification script: `.github/workflows/check-msrv.nu`
     * Virtualenv testing script: `scripts/test_virtualenv.nu`
   - Platform-specific build configurations
     * Tailored for x86_64 architecture
     * Consider storage limitations (55.9GB free)
   - WebAssembly build configuration files
   - Test configuration for different packages and targets

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - Expanded focus on:
     * x86_64 architecture compatibility
     * Parallel build testing (utilizing 96 cores)
     * Storage-efficient build processes
     * Memory-optimized testing (187.5GB available)
   - Test scenarios:
     * Standard library tests
     * Plugin system tests
     * WASM target compilation tests
     * Python virtualenv integration tests
     * Multi-platform build and test verification
   - Specific package testing (unchanged from previous plan)

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   - Continuous Integration Configuration
     * Optimize GitHub Actions for 96-core system
     * Implement parallel testing strategies
     * Configure storage-efficient builds
   - Build and Test Strategy
     * Implement multi-platform testing
     * Optimize for x86_64 architecture
     * Manage build processes within 55.9GB storage
   - Dependency and Feature Management
     * Verify Rust toolchain compatibility
     * Configure optional feature flags
     * Optimize for high-memory environment
   - Performance Optimization
     * Leverage 96-core processing capabilities
     * Implement efficient caching strategies
     * Minimize storage usage in build process

Verification Method:
- GitHub Actions workflow validation
- x86_64 architecture compatibility checks
- Parallel processing performance testing
- Storage and memory efficiency verification
- Cross-platform build and test validation
- Performance benchmarking across platforms

Key Adjustments:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Configured for 96-core parallel processing
- Adapted to 55.9GB storage constraints
- Leveraging 187.5GB available memory
- Maintained Ubuntu 22.04 base system compatibility
