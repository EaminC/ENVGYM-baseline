current progress
Docker build is failing during npm install, likely due to dependency conflicts or missing system packages. Current Dockerfile uses Ubuntu 22.04 base image with basic development tools and attempts to install npm packages directly.

next step
Update Dockerfile to:
1. Specify specific Node.js version using official Node image
2. Clear npm cache before installation
3. Add error logging for npm install
4. Verify package.json and package-lock.json are correctly copied
5. Use npm ci instead of npm install for more reliable dependency resolution
