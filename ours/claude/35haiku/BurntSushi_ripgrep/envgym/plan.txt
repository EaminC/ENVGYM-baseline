I apologize, but it seems like the original plan you mentioned is missing from your message. Without seeing the specific plan, I can provide a generalized Docker configuration template based on the hardware information you shared:

```dockerfile
# Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as base image for x86_64 architecture
FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS base

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/BurntSushi_ripgrep

# Use multi-stage build for efficiency
# Install necessary build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    git \
    ca-certificates \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Rust (since ripgrep is a Rust project)
RUN curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Build project
RUN cargo build --release

# Final stage
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Copy compiled binary from previous stage
COPY --from=base /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/BurntSushi_ripgrep/target/release/rg /usr/local/bin/rg

# Set entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/rg"]
```

Key adjustments based on hardware info:
- x86_64 architecture specification
- CPU-based image (no GPU)
- Multi-stage build
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base image
- Correct working directory path
- Rust installation for ripgrep build
- Lightweight, efficient configuration
