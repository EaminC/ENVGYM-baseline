current progress
Successfully created a multi-stage Docker build for x86_64 architecture using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, Python 3.7.16, and CPU-only PyTorch installation. Dockerfile includes virtual environment setup, dependency installation, and environment configuration. Previous Docker execution was successful.

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by:
1. Reducing image layers
2. Cleaning up unnecessary build artifacts
3. Verifying exact package version compatibility
4. Implementing more aggressive caching strategies
5. Minimizing final image size through careful layer management
