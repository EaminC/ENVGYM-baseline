I apologize, but I noticed that the original plan you mentioned is missing from your message. Without seeing the specific plan, I cannot provide a detailed adjustment. However, based on the hardware information you've shared, here's a generalized adjusted configuration plan:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for optimized, lightweight image
FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS base

# Set platform and architecture explicitly
LABEL platform=linux/amd64

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/CrossPrefetch

# Use CPU-based configuration
# No NVIDIA GPU specific configurations

# Install essential build tools and dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Final stage - minimal runtime image
FROM ubuntu:22.04

WORKDIR /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/CrossPrefetch

# Copy only necessary artifacts from base stage
COPY --from=base /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/CrossPrefetch .

# Set default command
CMD ["python3", "main.py"]
```

This plan takes into account the x86_64 architecture, Ubuntu 22.04 base, CPU-only environment, and follows multi-stage build principles for optimization.
