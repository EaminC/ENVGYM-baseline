=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Go (version 1.21+ for x86_64 architecture)
   - Git (compatible with x86_64)
   - goctl (go-zero CLI tool, latest version, x86_64 build)
   - Docker (version 28.3.2, with BuildKit support)
   - Visual Studio Code (x86_64 version)
   - GOPROXY configuration tool
   - Linters and formatters (golangci-lint, gofmt for x86_64)
   - Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc, x86_64 build)

2. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: golang:alpine (optimized for x86_64)
   - Multi-stage build strategy
   - Platform specification: --platform linux/amd64
   - Optimize for 96 logical cores
   - Minimize Docker image layers

3. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   - Base Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/zeromicro_go-zero
   - Ensure consistent path references
   - Create subdirectories with clear namespacing:
     * /mcp
     * /gateway
     * /tools
     * /config
     * /tests

4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Use alpine-based images for minimal footprint
   - Configure Go build with CGO_ENABLED=0 for static linking
   - Leverage multi-stage builds to reduce final image size
   - Implement build caching strategies

5. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Use go mod for dependency tracking
   - Set GOPROXY to speed up module downloads
   - Pin dependency versions for consistency
   - Focus on x86_64 compatible libraries

6. TESTING AND VALIDATION:
   - Create comprehensive test suites
   - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD on x86_64 architecture
   - Implement cross-platform compatibility checks
   - Performance testing with 96-core environment simulation

7. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use non-root containers
   - Implement least-privilege principles
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use official, verified base images

8. SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Remove ARM-specific configurations
   - Optimize for x86_64 instruction set
   - Ensure all tools support 64-bit architecture
   - Configure for standard Linux environment

9. RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
   - Design for efficient memory usage
   - Implement graceful degradation for resource-constrained environments
   - Use lightweight alternatives where possible
   - Configure timeouts and resource limits

10. MONITORING AND LOGGING:
    - Implement structured logging
    - Use lightweight tracing solutions
    - Configure log rotation and management
    - Ensure minimal performance overhead

CRITICAL NOTES:
- Confirm all downloaded tools are x86_64 compatible
- Use static linking where possible
- Leverage BuildKit features for efficient builds
- Optimize for 64-bit Linux environments
