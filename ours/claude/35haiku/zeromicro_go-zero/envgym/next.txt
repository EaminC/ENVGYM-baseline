current progress
Dockerfile build failed due to missing goctl binary in /usr/local/bin/goctl during multi-stage build. The build process attempts to copy goctl from the builder stage, but the binary is not being successfully generated. The build environment and toolchain are partially configured, with Go 1.21 and Alpine base images set up.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to explicitly download and install goctl from the official GitHub repository before building, using a direct curl/wget download of the pre-compiled binary or using go install with a specific version tag to ensure binary generation and placement in the expected location.
