=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   [Optimized for x86_64 architecture and high-performance hardware]
   - Node.js (v22+ with x86_64 binary)
   - nvm (Node Version Manager, x86_64 compatible)
   - npm (comes with Node.js)
   - Git (latest version for x86_64)
   - Vercel CLI 
   - Docker (28.x+ version, confirmed x86_64 support)
   - Lightweight API testing tool (curl/httpie as alternative to Postman)
   - Development Tools:
     * ESLint (flat config, optimized for 96-core environment)
     * Prettier 
     * Husky
     * Jest (with parallel test execution)
   
2. HARDWARE-OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Leverage 96-core CPU for:
     * Parallel builds
     * Concurrent testing
     * Optimized Docker multi-stage builds
   - Utilize 187.5GB RAM for:
     * Comprehensive dependency caching
     * In-memory build processes
     * Complex testing scenarios
   - Storage Optimization:
     * Implement aggressive layer caching
     * Use .dockerignore to minimize build context
     * Prefer slim/alpine base images

3. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x86_64)
   - Platform: linux/amd64
   - BuildKit Features:
     * Multi-stage builds
     * Cached dependency layers
     * Minimal image size

4. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Modify `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:
     * Specify x86_64 platform
     * Configure resource limits
     * Optimize VSCode extension installations
   - Update `package.json` scripts:
     * Add `--max-old-space-size` for Node.js
     * Configure Jest for parallel test execution
     * Add performance profiling scripts

5. STORAGE MANAGEMENT:
   - Implement aggressive `.dockerignore`
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
   - Configure npm/Docker cache management
   - Periodic cleanup scripts in DevContainer

6. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION:
   - Create comprehensive compatibility tests
   - Verify x86_64 specific configurations
   - Test cross-architecture compatibility
   - Performance benchmark scripts
   - Resource utilization monitoring

7. ADDITIONAL HARDWARE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Use `node:22-slim` as base image
   - Configure Node.js with V8 optimization flags
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Parallel build and test configurations

8. VERIFICATION METHOD:
   - `npm run test:parallel`
   - `npm run lint:performance`
   - Docker build time optimization checks
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Comprehensive architecture compatibility tests

Key Modifications:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Leveraged high-performance hardware
- Implemented storage-efficient configurations
- Added multi-core/high-memory performance scripts
- Ensured compatibility with 96-core, 187.5GB RAM environment
