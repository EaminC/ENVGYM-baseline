I apologize, but I cannot see the current plan or hardware information due to the error message you've shared. The error appears to be an API-related issue, which prevents me from accessing the specific details.

To provide a meaningful response, I would need:
1. The complete original environment configuration plan
2. Accurate hardware specifications (such as CPU type, RAM, storage, OS)

Could you please resend the plan and hardware information in a clear, complete format? Once I have those details, I can help you review and adjust the configuration to ensure compatibility and optimal setup.
