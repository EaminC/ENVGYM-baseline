=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Python 3.7.x (compatible with x86_64 architecture)
   - Git (Latest stable version for Linux)
   - pip (Latest version)
   - Virtual environment tool (venv)
   - Bash shell (confirmed available in Ubuntu/Debian)
   - Required Python libraries:
     * z3-solver (x86_64 compatible version)
     * tensorflow==2.5.0 (CPU-only version)
     * aif360
     * numpy
     * scikit-learn
     * pandas
     * matplotlib

2. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
   - Leverage large memory (187.5GB) for:
     * Comprehensive multi-stage builds
     * Complex compilation processes
     * Extended experiment runtime
   - Use standard base image (ubuntu:22.04 or debian:bullseye-slim)
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - No NVIDIA GPU optimizations required

3. DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Working Directory: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/Fairify`
   - Virtual Environment: `fenv/` in current working directory
   - Absolute path references adjusted for Linux environment

4. INSTALLATION STRATEGY:
   - Use multi-stage Docker build
   - Leverage BuildKit features
   - Implement CPU-only TensorFlow installation
   - Ensure x86_64 package compatibility

5. DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION APPROACH:
   - Use `pip` with `--no-cache-dir` for clean installations
   - Explicitly specify x86_64 compatible packages
   - Verify package integrity for Linux environment
   - Use `requirements.txt` for consistent dependency management

6. SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY UPDATES:
   - Confirmed Linux environment support
   - No WSL required
   - Leverage extensive memory (187.5GB)
   - Optimize for x86_64 instruction set
   - Use Ubuntu/Debian standard tools

7. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Utilize multi-core processor capabilities
   - Leverage large memory for complex computations
   - Implement efficient memory management
   - Use CPU-optimized libraries

8. TROUBLESHOOTING ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Add x86_64 specific package verification
   - Implement comprehensive compatibility checks
   - Create architecture-specific installation scripts
   - Add verbose logging for dependency resolution

9. RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
   - Use `apt-get` for system package management
   - Leverage Docker's multi-stage build capabilities
   - Implement comprehensive shell scripts for setup
   - Use Python's `venv` for virtual environment

10. SECURITY AND OPTIMIZATION:
    - Use official Ubuntu/Debian base images
    - Implement minimal image strategy
    - Leverage BuildKit for efficient builds
    - Optimize package installations

CRITICAL ADJUSTMENTS:
- Confirmed x86_64 architecture compatibility
- Optimized for large memory environment
- CPU-only TensorFlow installation
- Linux-native dependency management
- Leveraged Docker advanced build features

The plan remains fundamentally similar, with targeted optimizations for the specific x86_64 Linux environment with extensive memory resources.
