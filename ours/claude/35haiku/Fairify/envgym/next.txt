Dockerfile successfully created with Ubuntu 22.04 base, Python 3.10 environment, virtual environment setup, basic dependency installation including TensorFlow CPU, and project file copying. Build and runtime logs indicate successful execution.

next step
Enhance Dockerfile by adding explicit error handling for pip installations, implementing multi-stage build for reduced image size, adding package verification steps, and including comprehensive dependency compatibility checks for x86_64 architecture.
