I apologize, but it seems that the original plan was not included in your message. Without seeing the specific plan, I can provide a generalized Dockerfile template based on the hardware information you shared:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for Java/Maven project
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy project files
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Install Maven
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y maven && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Build the application
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Final stage
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy built artifact from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar

# Expose port if needed
# EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

Key adjustments based on hardware information:
- Uses openjdk:17-jdk-slim for x86_64 architecture
- Multi-stage build to reduce final image size
- Minimal layer count
- Compatible with Docker 28.3.2
- No GPU-specific configurations
- Working directory aligned with provided path
- Uses Maven for build process
