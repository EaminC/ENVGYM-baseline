current progress
Basic Ubuntu 22.04 base image created with essential development tools, git, and repository files copied. Dockerfile provides a generic development environment with bash entrypoint and executable permissions for all files.

next step
Refine Dockerfile by adding specific language/framework dependencies, specifying a precise build process, defining runtime configurations, and potentially adding multi-stage build for optimization.
