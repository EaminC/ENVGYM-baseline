=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Anaconda/Miniconda (x86_64 version)
   - Python (3.8 recommended for x86_64 compatibility)
   - R (latest version compatible with Ubuntu 22.04)
   - Git
   - Pip package manager
   - System dependencies:
     * libsdl libraries
     * build-essential
     * audio development libraries
     * graphics libraries
     * database client libraries
     * GDAL
     * MySQL/MariaDB
     * PostgreSQL
   - Required R packages:
     * r-base
     * r-eva
   - Additional Python libraries: (Keep existing list)

2. FILES TO CREATE: (Unchanged)
   - Paths adjusted to `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/flex/`

3. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
   a. Conda Installation:
      - Download Miniconda for x86_64 Linux
      - Use 64-bit Python installation
      - Allocate sufficient memory (187.5GB available)

   b. Environment Configuration:
      - Create conda environment with explicit x86_64 support
      - `conda create -n flex python=3.8 --platform linux/amd64`
      - Increase default memory allocation in conda config

   c. Dependency Management:
      - Use pip with `--no-cache-dir` for large memory environment
      - Leverage multi-stage Docker builds
      - Optimize package installation for x86_64 architecture

4. SYSTEM PREPARATION:
   - Update package lists for Ubuntu 22.04
   - Install development tools compatible with x86_64
   - Configure BuildKit for efficient builds
   - Ensure compatibility with Docker 28.3.2

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Use native x86_64 compiled packages
   - Leverage large memory for parallel installations
   - Configure pip and conda for x86_64 optimization
   - Use native compilation flags

6. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Add x86_64 specific compatibility tests
   - Verify multi-arch support
   - Test with Ubuntu 22.04 base image
   - Validate package installations on x86_64

7. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Use multi-stage builds
   - Optimize Dockerfile for x86_64
   - Minimize image size
   - Leverage BuildKit features

8. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Use `--platform linux/amd64` in Docker builds
   - Configure pip and conda for x86_64 specific optimizations
   - Validate cross-compilation compatibility

The core setup remains similar, with specific optimizations for x86_64 architecture, Ubuntu 22.04, and leveraging the large available memory (187.5GB).
