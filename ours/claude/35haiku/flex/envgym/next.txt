current progress
Dockerfile setup is incomplete. The build process fails during conda environment creation and package installation, likely due to shell configuration or package installation issues. The base image and system dependencies are correctly configured, but the environment setup and package installation steps are problematic.

next step
Modify the Dockerfile to:
1. Use `conda init bash` in the user's shell
2. Explicitly set shell to bash before conda commands
3. Ensure R package installation uses a non-interactive method
4. Add error handling and logging for package installation steps
5. Verify requirements.txt contents and package compatibility
