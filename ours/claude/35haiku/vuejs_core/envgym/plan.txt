=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   [Modifications for x86_64 architecture and Ubuntu 22.04]
   - Node.js (v18.12.0+ LTS version recommended for x86_64)
   - pnpm (v10.15.0) - verified for x86_64 compatibility
   - Git (latest version, optimized for x86_64)
   - Visual Studio Code or WebStorm (x86_64 native versions)
   - TypeScript (v5.6.2)
   - Rollup (v4.46.4)
   - Vite (v5.4.15)
   - Vitest (v3.2.4)
   - ESLint (v9.27.0)

   [Remaining dependencies unchanged]

2. DIRECTORIES AND PATHS:
   - Primary Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/vuejs_core
   - Adjust all package paths to use absolute paths
   - Ensure all package.json files use x86_64 compatible path references
   - Configure workspace with explicit path mappings

3. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Leverage 96 cores for parallel builds
     - Configure build scripts with max parallel processing
     - Use `--max-old-space-size` with Node.js to utilize large memory (187.5GB)
     - Implement multi-stage Docker builds
     - Use BuildKit cache mounts for efficient dependency management

4. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: node:18-bullseye (matches Ubuntu 22.04, x86_64)
   - Platform: linux/amd64
   - Dockerfile Optimization:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:18-bullseye AS base
     WORKDIR /app
     
     FROM base AS dependencies
     COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
     RUN corepack enable
     RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

     FROM dependencies AS build
     COPY . .
     RUN pnpm run build
     ```

5. PERFORMANCE TUNING:
   - Enable Node.js worker threads
   - Configure V8 engine for large memory utilization
   - Use `pnpm` with cache for faster dependency resolution
   - Implement aggressive caching in build processes

6. COMPATIBILITY CHECKS:
   - Verify all dependencies support x86_64
   - Test cross-package compatibility on Ubuntu 22.04
   - Validate build processes on the specified hardware configuration

7. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use explicit Node.js version management (nvm/volta)
   - Configure .npmrc for optimal package resolution
   - Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline supporting x86_64 architecture

[Remaining sections from original plan remain largely unchanged, with architecture-specific implementation details]

Key Adjustments:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Leveraged high-memory, high-core environment
- Docker-friendly configuration
- Performance and compatibility focused
