=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Miniconda (lighter weight than Anaconda, suitable for x86_64 architecture)
   - Python 3.8 (updated for better compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04)
   - Git 
   - System dependencies:
     * gcc/g++ compiler (latest version)
     * python3-dev
     * build-essential
     * libffi-dev (for additional library compatibility)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - `environment.yml` (Conda environment specification)
   - `.gitignore`
   - `requirements.txt` 
   - `config.json`
   - `environment_requirements.txt`
   - `install.sh` (Updated for Ubuntu 22.04)

3. HARDWARE-OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION:
   - Leverage 96-core processor for parallel builds
   - Utilize 187.5GB RAM for memory-intensive tasks
   - Configure for CPU-only processing
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Use multi-stage Docker build techniques

4. MODIFIED TODO LIST:
   a. System Preparation
      - Install Miniconda for x86_64
      - Verify Python 3.8 installation
      - Install system development tools
      - Configure Docker multi-stage build

   b. Repository Setup
      - Clone repository to /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/sixthsense
      - Set executable permissions:
        `chmod +x install.sh`

   c. Environment Configuration
      - Create conda environment with specific optimizations:
        `conda create -n ssense -y python=3.8 --no-default-packages`
      - Activate environment:
        `conda activate ssense`

   d. Dependency Installation
      - Use pip with CPU-optimized packages
      - Install requirements:
        `pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
      - Generate comprehensive requirements:
        `pip freeze > environment_requirements.txt`
      - Create project directories:
        `mkdir -p plots models results csvs`

   e. Performance Considerations
      - Disable GPU-specific libraries
      - Use CPU-optimized numpy/scipy
      - Configure scikit-learn for multi-core processing
      - Set environment variables for parallel processing

5. COMPATIBILITY ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Confirm x86_64 package compatibility
   - Verify Ubuntu 22.04 LTS support
   - Test with Docker 28.3.2
   - Ensure BuildKit compatibility
   - Use multi-stage Dockerfile for efficient builds

6. VERIFICATION STEPS:
   - Run system compatibility checks
   - Validate multi-core processing
   - Test memory-intensive operations
   - Verify library imports
   - Confirm CPU-only machine learning workflows

Compatibility Notes:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base image
- Python 3.8 as primary version
- CPU-only processing configuration
- Leveraging 96-core, 187.5GB RAM environment

Potential Optimization Flags:
- OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=96
- MKL_NUM_THREADS=96
- OMP_NUM_THREADS=96
