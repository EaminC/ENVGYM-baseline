=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Go (compatible with x86_64)
     * Confirmed versions: Go 1.24 or Go 1.25 (x86_64 native support)
     * Download from official Golang website
   - Git (for version control, x86_64 compatible)
   - Code editor (VSCode/GoLand recommended)
   - Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc, x86_64 build)
     * Required for gRPC code generation
   - gRPC dependencies (x86_64 optimized)
     * Same as original plan, no changes needed
   - OpenTelemetry Libraries (x86_64 compatible)
     * Same as original plan
   - Cryptography and Security Libraries
     * Same as original plan
   - Additional Development Tools
     * Same as original plan
   - Cloud Platform Integration
     * Same as original plan
   - Performance and Utility Libraries
     * Same as original plan
   - Build and Testing Tools
     * Make utility (x86_64 native)
     * Go testing frameworks
     * Race condition detection tools

2. DOCKERFILE MODIFICATIONS:
   - Base Image: golang:alpine (lightweight, x86_64 compatible)
   - Multi-stage build optimization
   - Use .dockerignore to minimize context
   - Minimize image layers
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture

3. STORAGE AND MEMORY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Minimum 16GB RAM recommended
   - SSD storage preferred (minimum 50GB)
   - Allocate sufficient disk space for dependencies and build cache
   - Configure Docker volume management
   - Implement build caching strategies

4. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/grpc_grpc-go
   - Set GOPATH and GOROOT appropriately
   - Configure GO111MODULE=on
   - Use go mod vendor for dependency management
   - Implement caching in CI/CD pipelines

5. TOOLCHAIN OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use native x86_64 compilation flags
   - Enable CGO_ENABLED for specific native libraries
   - Configure build tags for x86_64 optimization
   - Use -buildmode=pie for enhanced security
   - Implement static linking where possible

6. TESTING AND VALIDATION:
   - All test cases from original plan remain unchanged
   - Add architecture-specific validation tests
   - Verify cross-compilation capabilities
   - Test on multiple Go versions
   - Validate Docker build process

7. ADDITIONAL HARDWARE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - No GPU acceleration needed
   - Focus on CPU-level optimizations
   - Use native Go concurrency features
   - Implement efficient goroutine management
   - Optimize for multi-core x86_64 processors

8. COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
   - Full x86_64 architecture support
   - Docker 28.3.2 compatibility confirmed
   - BuildKit and multi-stage build support
   - No special CUDA or GPU requirements
   - Supports standard cloud and local deployments

Key Adjustments:
- Lightweight alpine-based Docker image
- x86_64 native optimization
- Efficient resource utilization
- Simplified build process
- Enhanced security configurations

The plan maintains the original comprehensive approach while optimizing for the specific x86_64 hardware environment.
