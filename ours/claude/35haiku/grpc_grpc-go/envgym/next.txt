current progress
Docker build process is failing during the compilation of protoc-gen-go-grpc, specifically in the cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc directory. The build is not completing successfully, indicating potential issues with build configuration, dependencies, or source code compatibility.

next step
Modify Dockerfile to:
1. Verify exact directory structure and main.go file in cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc
2. Add verbose error logging to diagnose build failure
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
4. Check Go module and build path configurations
5. Validate protoc-gen-go-grpc source code for compilation readiness
