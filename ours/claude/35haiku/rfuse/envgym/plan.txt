I apologize, but you haven't provided the current plan that you want me to review and adjust. Without seeing the specific plan, I cannot provide a detailed adjustment. Could you please share the original plan you'd like me to review in the context of the hardware information you've provided? 

If you'd like me to help, please paste the original plan, and I'll be happy to review it carefully considering the hardware specifications you've outlined, such as:
- x86_64 architecture
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base
- No NVIDIA GPU
- 187.5GB memory
- Docker 28.3.2
- Working directory at /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/rfuse
