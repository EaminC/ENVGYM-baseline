=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Python 2.7 (compatible with x86_64 architecture)
   - Python pip package manager (for x86_64)
   - Java Development Kit (Oracle Java 8, x86_64 version)
   - System utilities:
     * bc (basic calculator)
     * antlr4
     * wget
     * git
   - Python libraries (x86_64 compatible):
     * antlr4-python2-runtime
     * six
     * astunparse
     * ast
     * pystan
     * edward
     * pyro-ppl (version 0.2.1, CPU-specific)
     * tensorflow (version 1.5.0, CPU build)
     * pandas
     * torch (version 0.4.0, CPU-specific wheel for x86_64)
   - Additional dependencies:
     * Stan probabilistic programming framework (x86_64 build)
     * Edward (TensorFlow-based probabilistic library)
     * Pyro (PyTorch-based probabilistic programming language)
     * Venture probabilistic programming language
     * Psi probabilistic programming framework

2. MODIFICATIONS FOR HARDWARE:
   - Dockerfile Considerations:
     * Use ubuntu:22.04 as base image
     * Multi-stage build to optimize image size
     * Leverage large memory (187.5GB) for complex compilations
     * Ensure x86_64 architecture compatibility
     * No NVIDIA GPU support - use CPU-only configurations

3. STORAGE AND PATH ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/probfuzz
   - Ensure sufficient disk space for:
     * Python 2.7 installation
     * Java Development Kit
     * Multiple probabilistic programming libraries
   - Create dedicated volumes for:
     * Library installations
     * Temporary compilation spaces
     * Persistent configuration storage

4. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - Docker Build Optimizations:
     * Use BuildKit for efficient layer caching
     * Minimize image size
     * Optimize for x86_64 CPU instructions
   - Memory Allocation:
     * Leverage 187.5GB RAM for:
       - Parallel library compilations
       - Complex probabilistic model testing
       - Extensive test suite execution

5. COMPATIBILITY CHECKLIST:
   - Verify x86_64 package compatibility
   - Confirm Ubuntu 22.04 LTS support
   - Test CPU-only library configurations
   - Validate Python 2.7 runtime on modern Ubuntu
   - Ensure no ARM-specific dependencies

6. RECOMMENDED DOCKER BUILD STRATEGY:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS base
   # x86_64 specific configurations
   # Multi-stage build for optimization
   # CPU-only library installations
   ```

7. KEY ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Remove GPU-specific configurations
   - Optimize for x86_64 CPU architecture
   - Leverage large memory capabilities
   - Ensure Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility
   - Use Docker BuildKit features
   - Focus on CPU-based probabilistic computing

8. TESTING PRIORITIES:
   - x86_64 architecture compatibility
   - CPU-only library performance
   - Ubuntu 22.04 system integration
   - Python 2.7 runtime validation
   - Probabilistic programming framework tests

Verification Method:
- Successful Docker image build
- Complete library installations
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- No architecture-related compatibility issues
