=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - C++ Compiler (x86_64 optimized):
     - GCC 11-13 (native x86_64 support)
     - Clang 12-14 (x86_64 optimized)
     - MSVC 2022 (v143, cross-compilation support)
     - MinGW-w64 for x86_64
   - CMake (3.22 - 3.26, x86_64 optimized)
   - Git (latest stable version)
   - Bazel (7.0+ with x86_64 support)
   - Docker BuildKit tools
   - Virtualization:
     - Docker (primary virtualization method)
     - Podman (alternative container runtime)
   - Documentation Tools:
     - MkDocs (Python 3.8+)
     - MkDocs Material Theme
     - Doxygen
   - Python Dependencies:
     - pymdownx
     - mkdocstrings
     - virtualenv

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - Docker-specific files:
     - `Dockerfile`
     - `docker-compose.yml`
     - `.dockerignore`
   - Existing configuration files:
     - `.gitignore`
     - `CMakeLists.txt`
     - `WORKSPACE.bazel`
     - `.clang-format`
   - CI/CD Workflows:
     - `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`
     - `.github/workflows/linux-test.yml`
     - `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`

3. OPTIMIZATION CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds
   - Leverage BuildKit caching mechanisms
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Minimize layer count
   - Use slim base images
   - Configure for large memory environment (187.5GB)

4. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
   - Primary Development Platform: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code
   - Container-based development workflow
   - Use Docker for consistent environment

5. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Docker-based testing environments
   - Containerized CI/CD pipelines
   - Cross-compilation testing
   - Performance benchmarking on x86_64

6. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Compiler: Focus on GCC and Clang for x86_64
   - Build Tools: Bazel and CMake with x86_64 optimizations
   - Memory Management: Leverage large available RAM
   - Storage: Use efficient layered Docker builds
   - No GPU-specific configurations needed

7. RECOMMENDED TOOLCHAIN:
   - Compiler: GCC 13 or Clang 14
   - Build System: Bazel 7.0, CMake 3.26
   - Container Runtime: Docker with BuildKit
   - Development Environment: VSCode + Dev Containers

8. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use native x86_64 compilation flags
   - Enable link-time optimization
   - Configure for large memory environment
   - Implement efficient caching strategies

9. CROSS-PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Maintain Linux/x86_64 primary focus
   - Provide cross-compilation support
   - Ensure compatibility with major distributions

10. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
    - Validate Docker build process
    - Test container portability
    - Verify build configurations
    - Check architecture-specific optimizations
    - Validate documentation generation
    - Test CI/CD pipeline integration

This adjusted plan optimizes the original setup for the x86_64 Ubuntu environment, leveraging the large memory and focusing on containerized, efficient development workflows.
