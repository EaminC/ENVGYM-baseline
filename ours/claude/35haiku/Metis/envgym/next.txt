current progress
Dockerfile successfully builds a multi-stage Ubuntu 22.04 development environment with x86_64 toolchain, including GCC 11, Python 3, development libraries, and scientific computing packages. Previous execution logs indicate successful build and runtime. Current configuration matches most original environment setup plan requirements.

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by:
1. Reduce final image size by removing redundant package installations
2. Implement .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
3. Add explicit version pinning for critical packages
4. Enhance caching strategy in multi-stage build
5. Add explicit Python virtual environment configuration
6. Implement lightweight security hardening
