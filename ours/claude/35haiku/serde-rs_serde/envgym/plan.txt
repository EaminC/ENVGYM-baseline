=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust Programming Language (Stable Channel)
     * Specific Version: 1.74.0+ (latest stable for x86_64)
     * Download from: https://rustup.rs/
   - Cargo (Rust Package Manager, included with Rust installation)
   - Workspace Dependencies:
     * proc-macro2 = "1.0.74" (x86_64 optimized, default-features = false)
     * quote = "1.0.35" (x86_64 optimized, default-features = false)
     * syn = "2.0.81" (x86_64 optimized, default-features = false)
   - Additional x86_64 Specific Optimizations:
     * libc = "0.2.151" (with x86_64 support)
     * serde = "1.0.195"
     * serde_json = "1.0.108"

2. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATIONS:
   - Base Image: rust:slim-bullseye (optimized for x86_64)
   - Target Platform: linux/amd64
   - Toolchain Configuration:
     * rust-toolchain.toml: 
       - channel = "stable"
       - targets = ["x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"]
   - Cross-Compilation Targets:
     * x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (primary)
     * x86_64-unknown-linux-musl (static linking)

3. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ADJUSTMENTS:
   - IDE/Tools:
     * rust-analyzer (lightweight LSP for x86_64)
     * rustfmt (code formatting)
     * clippy (x86_64 optimized linting)
   - Build Optimization:
     * Use multi-stage Docker build
     * Leverage 48 physical cores with parallel compilation
     * Configure cargo with optimal CPU target flags

4. STORAGE AND MEMORY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Workspace Location: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/serde-rs_serde
   - Recommended Minimum Requirements:
     * 16GB RAM
     * 50GB SSD storage
   - Docker Build Optimizations:
     * Use --mount=type=cache for dependency caching
     * Minimize intermediate layers
     * Use slim base image to reduce image size

5. TESTING AND COMPATIBILITY:
   - Test Configurations:
     * Prioritize x86_64 native testing
     * Validate no-std compatibility
     * Cross-compile verification
   - CI/CD Considerations:
     * GitHub Actions with x86_64 runners
     * Docker BuildKit caching strategies

6. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Cargo.toml Modifications:
     * Explicit x86_64 target specifications
     * Minimal feature flags
     * Workspace resolver = "2"
   - Local Path Dependencies:
     * Optimize for x86_64 architecture
     * Minimal runtime requirements

7. PERFORMANCE TUNING:
   - Compiler Flags:
     * RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"
     * Optimize for current x86_64 microarchitecture
   - Build Strategies:
     * Parallel compilation (48 cores)
     * Incremental compilation enabled
     * LTO (Link Time Optimization) for release builds

8. SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE:
   - Use official Rust images
   - Implement minimal dependency tree
   - Verify no unnecessary system access
   - Implement strict panic handling

Key Adjustments:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Slim Docker image selection
- Leveraged 48-core parallel processing
- Refined no-std and cross-compilation support
- Minimal resource consumption strategy
- Enhanced build and testing configurations

Verification Checkpoints:
- ✓ x86_64 native compilation
- ✓ No-std compatibility
- ✓ Minimal runtime requirements
- ✓ Efficient resource utilization
- ✓ Cross-platform build support
