=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   [UNCHANGED, COMPATIBLE WITH x86_64 ARCHITECTURE]
   - All previously listed tools remain valid
   - Specific version adjustments for x86_64/Linux compatibility:
     * Use GraalVM CE for Linux x86_64
     * Confirm Maven and Python x86_64 builds
     * Verify Docker image compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   [MINIMAL MODIFICATIONS]
   - Add explicit Linux/x86_64 path handling
   - Adjust `.env` for Linux environment variables
   - Create platform-specific `run.sh` with x86_64 optimizations

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   [ENHANCED FOR x86_64 LINUX ENVIRONMENT]
   - Add x86_64-specific performance tests
   - Validate CPU instruction set compatibility
   - Ensure multi-core/multi-thread testing support
   - Add Linux-specific system integration tests

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   A. PREREQUISITE SETUP
   - [x] Verify x86_64 architecture compatibility
   - [x] Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as base image
   - [ ] Install x86_64-optimized development tools
   - [ ] Configure large memory (187.5GB) build strategies
   - [ ] Use Docker BuildKit for efficient multi-stage builds

   B. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
   - [ ] Optimize for x86_64 instruction set
   - [ ] Configure Linux-specific environment paths
   - [ ] Set up CPU-only compilation strategies
   - [ ] Configure large memory build parameters

   C. DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION
   - [ ] Use Linux-compatible package managers
   - [ ] Verify package compatibility with x86_64
   - [ ] Configure multi-core compilation

   D. PROJECT INITIALIZATION
   - [ ] Use Linux filesystem conventions
   - [ ] Configure x86_64 specific compiler flags
   - [ ] Optimize for Linux development environment

   E. TESTING WORKFLOW
   - [ ] Add x86_64 performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Configure multi-core test execution
   - [ ] Validate Linux-specific test scenarios

COMPATIBILITY UPDATES:
- Confirmed x86_64 architecture support
- Optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Large memory (187.5GB) build strategies
- CPU-only development environment
- Linux filesystem and path conventions
- Docker 28.3.2 BuildKit compatibility
- Multi-core test and compilation support

HARDWARE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Docker base image
- Leverage large memory for complex builds
- Configure x86_64 instruction set optimizations
- Use CPU-focused development strategies
- Implement multi-core compilation techniques

VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS:
- Validate x86_64 architecture compatibility
- Confirm Linux environment integration
- Verify multi-core performance
- Test large memory build capabilities
- Ensure Docker BuildKit compatibility

The plan remains fundamentally unchanged but is now explicitly optimized for the x86_64 Linux environment with specific considerations for the available hardware characteristics.
