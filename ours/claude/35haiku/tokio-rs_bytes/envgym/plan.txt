=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust Programming Language (rustc)
     * Version: 1.57.0 or higher
     * Explicitly target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
     * Stable and nightly channels
   - Cargo (Rust package manager)
     * Official installation via rustup for x86_64
   - Additional Tools:
     * cargo-hack (for feature testing)
     * rust-src component
     * Cross-compilation toolchains for x86_64
   - Optional Dependencies:
     * Serde (version 1.0.60)
     * portable-atomic (version 1.3)
     * loom (version 0.7)
   - Development Tools:
     * Git (latest version)
     * Clippy
     * rustfmt
     * rust-analyzer

2. CROSS-COMPILATION TARGETS (PRIORITIZED):
   - x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (primary)
   - x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
   - wasm32-wasip1
   - Remove ARM and PowerPC targets due to x86_64 architecture

3. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: rust:latest-bullseye
   - Multi-stage build recommended
   - Leverage 187.5GB memory for comprehensive testing
   - Use BuildKit features for efficient caching

4. ENVIRONMENT PATHS:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/tokio-rs_bytes
   - Configure rust toolchain in /usr/local/rust
   - Use standard Linux filesystem hierarchy

5. OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
   - Slim Docker image variants
   - Minimize cross-compilation overhead
   - Focus on x86_64 native performance
   - Leverage large memory for parallel testing

6. CI/CD ADJUSTMENTS:
   - GitHub Actions workflow optimized for x86_64
   - Remove non-compatible architecture tests
   - Focus on x86_64 Linux testing matrix
   - Use GitHub-hosted x86_64 runners

7. TEST COVERAGE:
   - Prioritize x86_64 native testing
   - No_std compatibility verification
   - Performance benchmarks on x86_64
   - Comprehensive stable/nightly testing
   - Concurrency and atomic operation tests

8. TOOLCHAIN MANAGEMENT:
   - Use rustup for version management
   - Install rust-src for cross-compilation support
   - Configure cargo with x86_64 targets
   - Enable comprehensive feature testing

9. STORAGE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Allocate sufficient space for toolchains
   - Use Docker volume management
   - Implement cleanup strategies in CI/CD

10. VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
    - Confirm x86_64 Rust toolchain compatibility
    - Validate Docker build process
    - Verify GitHub Actions workflow
    - Test no_std and feature flag support
    - Ensure comprehensive test coverage

Modifications focus on x86_64 architecture optimization, leveraging available hardware capabilities while maintaining a flexible, comprehensive development environment.
