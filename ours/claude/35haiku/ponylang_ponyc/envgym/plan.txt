     * Make
     * CMake (version 3.22 or higher)
   - Programming Languages:
     * Python 3.10+ (required for LLVM build)
     * Python 3 pip
   - Compiler and Development Dependencies:
     * LLVM (with x86_64 target optimization)
     * Google Test
     * Google Benchmark
     * binutils-gold
     * libatomic
     * libstdc++-static
     * zlib-dev
     * Ubuntu/Debian build base
   - Platform-specific requirements:
     * Linux: 
       - Ubuntu 22.04 specific packages
       - build-essential
       - linux-headers
       - coreutils
   - Optional Development Tools:
     * Valgrind
     * Address/Thread/Undefined Behavior Sanitizers
     * Coverage tools
     * GDB
     * LLDB
   - Docker (for containerized development)
     * Docker Engine 28.3.2+
     * BuildKit support
     * Docker Compose
   - Recommended IDEs/Editors with Pony support:
     * Visual Studio Code
     * Sublime Text

2. MODIFICATIONS FOR x86_64 ARCHITECTURE:
   - Optimize build configurations for 96 logical cores
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds
   - Adjust compilation flags for x86_64 architecture
   - Configure parallel compilation strategies
   - Implement core-aware build processes

3. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Create multi-stage Dockerfile
   - Optimize build caching
   - Use BuildKit features
   - Implement multi-arch support for x86_64
   - Configure non-root user with sudo access

4. TEST CASE PRIORITIES:
   - Focus on x86_64 architecture validation
   - Optimize for 96-core parallel testing
   - Implement distributed testing strategies
   - Validate Ubuntu 22.04 LTS compatibility
   - Test with high-concurrency scenarios

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Configure build with -j$(nproc) for max core utilization
   - Implement ccache for faster rebuilds
   - Use link-time optimization (LTO)
   - Configure memory-aware compilation flags
   - Implement distributed compilation support

6. STORAGE AND MEMORY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Allocate minimum 32GB RAM for compilation
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
   - Configure swap space if needed
   - Optimize Docker layer caching

7. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
   - Use Ubuntu 22.04 as base development image
   - Configure system-wide compiler settings
   - Set up development user with sudo privileges
   - Implement secure, reproducible build environment
   - Create standardized development container

8. VERIFICATION METHOD:
   - Validate x86_64 specific build configurations
   - Test parallel compilation on 96 cores
   - Verify Docker build with BuildKit
   - Run comprehensive test suite with high concurrency
   - Validate Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility
   - Test multi-stage build process
   - Confirm non-root user functionality

Key Adjustments:
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS focus
- 96-core compilation support
- BuildKit and multi-stage Docker builds
- Enhanced performance configurations
- Simplified dependency management
