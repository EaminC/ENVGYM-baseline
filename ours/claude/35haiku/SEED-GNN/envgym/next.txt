current progress
Docker configuration completed for CPU-based environment
Python 3.8 slim base image selected
Required machine learning libraries installed
Project directory and permissions configured
Basic Docker build and runtime successful

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by:
- Combining RUN commands to reduce image layers
- Cleaning up apt cache in single layer
- Adding multi-stage build for smaller final image
- Implementing explicit CMD for main.py execution
- Verifying all dependencies are correctly installed
- Adding error handling and logging mechanisms
