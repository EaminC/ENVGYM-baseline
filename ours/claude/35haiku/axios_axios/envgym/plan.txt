=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Node.js (v16.20.x LTS recommended, verified x86_64 compatibility)
   - npm (8.19.x+)
   - Git (2.x+)
   - Visual Studio Code or WebStorm
   - Optional: Postman for API testing
   - Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge (verified x86_64 support)
   - TypeScript (4.9.x)
   - ts-node
   - @types/node

2. HARDWARE-OPTIMIZED CONFIGURATION:
   - Multi-stage Docker build strategy
   - Leverage large memory (187.5GB) for parallel processing
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Use debian:bullseye-slim as base image
   - Configure BuildKit for efficient layer management

3. TOOLCHAIN ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Webpack (5.x, x86_64 optimized)
   - Gulp (latest, verified compatibility)
   - ESLint (8.x)
   - Testing Frameworks:
     * Jasmine (optimized build)
     * Mocha (x86_64 compatible)

4. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/axios_axios
   - Persistent volume mapping
   - User namespace remapping
   - Non-root container user configuration

5. FILES TO CREATE:
   [Previous list remains the same, with additional notes]
   - `.dockerignore` (optimize Docker build context)
   - `docker-compose.yml` (multi-stage build configuration)

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Use npm ci for faster, more reliable installations
   - Implement cached dependency layers
   - Configure Node.js with V8 optimization flags
   - Use Alpine-based Node.js images for smaller footprint

7. COMPATIBILITY CHECKLIST:
   - Verify x86_64 binary compatibility
   - Test on debian:bullseye-slim
   - Validate package.json with architecture-specific dependencies
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility
   - Configure GitHub Actions for x86_64 builds

8. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use official Node.js images
   - Implement least-privilege container user
   - Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use npm audit and Snyk for security checks

9. MIGRATION STRATEGY:
   - Incremental migration support
   - Compatibility matrix for x86_64
   - Semver-compliant upgrade paths
   - Detailed migration documentation

10. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
    - Docker Compose for local development
    - VSCode Remote Containers support
    - CI/CD pipeline configuration
    - Automated testing in x86_64 environment

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Leverage large memory for parallel builds
- Use BuildKit for efficient caching
- Optimize for x86_64 instruction set
- Minimal layer size in Docker builds
- Persistent volume management
- Non-root container best practices

VERIFICATION METHOD:
- Architecture-specific compatibility tests
- Multi-stage build validation
- Performance benchmark
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Cross-platform compatibility checks
