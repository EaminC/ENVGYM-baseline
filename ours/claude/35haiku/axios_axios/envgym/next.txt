current progress
Successfully configured multi-stage Docker build for Node.js 16.20.2 environment with security best practices, non-root user configuration, and optimized build process. Dockerfile includes base, builder, and runtime stages with dependency installation, build process, and minimal image creation.

next step
Enhance security by adding npm audit step, implement explicit volume mounting configuration, add healthcheck instruction, configure explicit Node.js runtime flags, and optimize final image size by using Alpine-based Node.js image instead of Debian slim.
