current progress
Successfully created a multi-stage Docker build for x86_64 architecture with Ubuntu 22.04, configured a Python 3.10 virtual environment, installed CPU-only PyTorch, and added key development dependencies. Docker build and runtime were successful, meeting most environment setup requirements.

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by:
1. Reducing layer count
2. Implementing more efficient dependency caching
3. Adding version pinning for all pip packages
4. Implementing a multi-stage build to further reduce final image size
5. Adding explicit version checks for critical dependencies
6. Implementing a more robust entrypoint/CMD strategy
