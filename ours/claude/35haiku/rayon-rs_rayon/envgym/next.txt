current progress
Dockerfile build is failing due to incorrect binary path, likely from nested project structure. Docker build cannot locate the compiled binary in the specified location. Build process successfully compiles Rust project but cannot transfer executable between build stages.

next step
1. Verify exact binary output path in rayon-demo/target/release/
2. Modify Dockerfile to use precise binary path
3. Ensure COPY command uses correct source and destination paths
4. Add verbose logging or debug flags to verify binary compilation and location
5. Potentially adjust multi-stage build to account for nested project structure
