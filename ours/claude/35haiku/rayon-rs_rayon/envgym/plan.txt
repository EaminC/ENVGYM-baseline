=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Rust Programming Language (rustc 1.80.0 or greater) [CONFIRMED]
   - Cargo Package Manager
   - Git (for version control and cloning)
   - Optional: Visual Studio Code or Rust-compatible IDE

   HARDWARE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Ensure x86_64 compatible Rust toolchain
   - Use slim base image (rust:slim-bullseye) for minimal footprint
   - Verify all dependencies support x86_64 Linux architecture

2. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Use multi-stage build to optimize image size
   - Leverage BuildKit cache for dependency management
   - Dockerfile optimization:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM rust:slim-bullseye AS builder
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN cargo build --release
     
     FROM debian:bullseye-slim
     COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/rayon-demo /usr/local/bin/
     ```

3. FILES TO CREATE:
   - Existing Cargo.toml files (unchanged)
   - Update rayon-demo/Cargo.toml
     - Remove Windows-specific dependencies if not needed
     - Ensure all dependencies are x86_64 compatible
     - Simplify platform-specific configurations

4. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Prioritize Linux/x86_64 compatible dependencies
   - Remove or conditionally include Windows-specific packages
   - Verify libc and system-level dependencies for x86_64 Linux

5. TEST STRATEGY:
   - Focus on x86_64 Linux compatibility tests
   - Simplify cross-platform testing
   - Prioritize Linux-specific test cases
   - Use GitHub Actions or similar CI for comprehensive testing

6. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Leverage native CPU instructions
   - Minimize runtime overhead
   - Use native Linux performance tools

7. STORAGE AND MEMORY OPTIMIZATION:
   - Target minimal image size (<500MB)
   - Use slim base images
   - Implement multi-stage builds
   - Minimize unnecessary dependencies

8. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
   - Use VSCode with rust-analyzer
   - Configure dev container for consistent environment
   - Leverage Docker for reproducible setup

9. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
   - GitHub Actions workflow for x86_64 Linux
   - Automated dependency checks
   - Performance and compatibility testing

VERIFICATION METHOD:
- Successful build on x86_64 Linux
- All tests pass on target architecture
- Minimal image size and footprint
- Consistent performance on x86_64 platform
- No Windows or non-Linux dependencies

CRITICAL ADJUSTMENTS:
- Remove Windows-specific configurations
- Optimize for Linux/x86_64 environment
- Minimize external dependencies
- Ensure lightweight, performant setup
