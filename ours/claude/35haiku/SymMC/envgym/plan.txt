=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - OpenJDK 8 (Java Development Kit) for x86_64
   - Apache Ant (Build tool, x86_64 compatible)
   - CMake (version 3.10+ recommended for x86_64)
   - MiniSat (x86_64 build)
   - Git (for repository cloning)
   - GCC/G++ compiler (with x86_64 support, version 9.4+ recommended)
   - Python 3.8+ (for additional scripting)
   - Slim development libraries optimized for x86_64

2. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: ubuntu:22.04 or debian:bullseye-slim
   - Platform: linux/amd64
   - Multi-stage build recommended
   - Minimize image layers
   - Use --platform linux/amd64 during build

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   - Set in Dockerfile or docker-compose
   - Use ARG for build-time variables
   - Use ENV for runtime environment configuration
   - Explicitly define PATH for x86_64 binaries

4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
   - Base working directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/SymMC
   - Create consistent volume mounts
   - Ensure proper permissions (chmod +x for scripts)
   - Use non-root user for security

5. DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION:
   - Consolidated installation in single RUN command
   - Use apt-get with --no-install-recommends
   - Pin specific package versions
   - Clean apt cache to reduce image size

6. BUILD OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use CMake 3.10+ with x86_64 optimizations
   - Enable -O2 or -O3 compiler optimization flags
   - Leverage x86_64 instruction set capabilities
   - Compile with native architecture support

7. LIBRARY MANAGEMENT:
   - Prefer static linking where possible
   - Use slim versions of libraries
   - Verify x86_64 compatibility of all dependencies
   - Minimize external library dependencies

8. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Dockerized testing environment
   - Use multi-stage build for testing
   - Implement lightweight CI/CD checks
   - Verify cross-compilation compatibility

9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use non-root container user
   - Implement least privilege principle
   - Scan for vulnerabilities in base image
   - Use trusted, slim base images

10. PERFORMANCE TUNING:
    - Allocate appropriate memory limits
    - Configure CPU shares
    - Use Docker BuildKit for efficient builds
    - Leverage caching strategies

RECOMMENDED DOCKERFILE STRUCTURE:
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS builder
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
WORKDIR /app

# Consolidated dependency installation
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    openjdk-8-jdk \
    cmake \
    git \
    gcc \
    g++ \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Subsequent build steps...
```

KEY MODIFICATIONS:
- Aligned with x86_64 architecture
- Optimized for Ubuntu 22.04
- Simplified dependency management
- Enhanced build and security configurations
- Prepared for containerized development environment
