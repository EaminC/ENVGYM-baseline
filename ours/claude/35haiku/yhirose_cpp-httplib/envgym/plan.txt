=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - C++ Compiler (g++ 9.4+ for Ubuntu 22.04)
   - CMake (3.14.0+ required)
   - Meson (0.63.0+ required)
   - Python 3.10+ (for build scripts)
   - OpenSSL Development Libraries (3.0.0+)
   - Zlib Development Libraries
   - Brotli Compression Library
   - Zstd Compression Library
   - Curl Development Libraries
   - Git (for version control)
   - Static linking tools
   - pkg-config 
   - Threads library support
   - clang-format (for style checking)

2. DOCKER OPTIMIZATION CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use multi-stage builds
   - Leverage Ubuntu 22.04 as base image
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Minimize layer count
   - Use BuildKit for efficient caching
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies

3. FILES TO CREATE:
   - Dockerfile (optimized for x86_64)
   - docker-compose.yml
   - CMakeLists.txt
   - meson.build
   - .github/workflows/ci.yml
   - .github/workflows/test.yml
   - config.h (optional)
   - .gitignore

4. BUILD CONFIGURATION ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Target x86_64 architecture specifically
   - Optimize for 64-bit compilation
   - Use native CPU instruction sets
   - Implement lightweight build strategies
   - Reduce memory-intensive compilation steps

5. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Focus on x86_64 platform compatibility
   - Lightweight cross-compilation tests
   - Minimize resource-intensive testing
   - Leverage GitHub Actions for CI/CD
   - Use cached dependencies

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Use -O2 or -O3 optimization flags
   - Enable link-time optimization (LTO)
   - Leverage native CPU instructions
   - Minimize runtime overhead
   - Use static linking where possible

7. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Use pkg-config for library detection
   - Prefer system libraries
   - Minimize external dependency downloads
   - Use Ubuntu 22.04 package management
   - Leverage built-in system libraries

8. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
   - GitHub Actions workflow for x86_64
   - Linux-based testing environment
   - Parallel job execution
   - Cached dependency management
   - Lightweight testing matrix

9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use latest OpenSSL libraries
   - Enable compiler security flags
   - Minimize attack surface
   - Use up-to-date system libraries
   - Implement basic ASLR and stack protector

10. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT:
    - Use /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/yhirose_cpp-httplib as primary workspace
    - Configure paths for local development
    - Support local and containerized builds
    - Provide flexible build options

VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
- Successful x86_64 compilation
- Minimal resource consumption
- Efficient multi-stage Docker build
- Complete library compatibility
- Lightweight and fast CI/CD pipeline
- Secure and optimized build process
