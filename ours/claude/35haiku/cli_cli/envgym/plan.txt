=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - GitHub CLI (gh) latest version (x86_64 compatible)
   - Git (latest version for x86_64)
   - Go programming language (version 1.24+ for x86_64)
   - VSCode DevContainer extension
   - Cross-compilation toolchain for x86_64
   - Build and compilation tools:
     * Make
     * CGO
     * Go build tools
   - Package managers:
     * Homebrew (for macOS)
     * WinGet (for Windows)
     * Conda
     * Flox
     * Webi
     * Chocolatey (for Windows)
     * Linux package managers (apt for Ubuntu)
   - Optional: cosign (for binary verification)
   - Development tools:
     * GCC/Clang compiler toolchain
     * Golang linting tools (golangci-lint)
     * Cross-platform build tools
   - CI/CD Dependencies:
     * Actions checkout v5
     * Actions setup-go v5
     * DevContainer configuration tools
   - Cross-compilation dependencies:
     * GOOS and GOARCH environment variables
     * CGO_ENABLED configuration
     * Linker flag support (-s -w)

2. FILES TO CREATE:
   - docs/install_source.md
   - docs/codespaces.md
   - Cross-compilation configuration files:
     * Cross-platform build scripts
     * GOOS/GOARCH configuration templates
     * Platform-specific build configuration
   - Build output directories:
     * ./bin
     * ./build
   - Cross-compilation result tracking files
   - Makefile updates for cross-compilation targets
   - DevContainer configuration files

3. NECESSARY TEST CASES:
   - Cross-compilation verification tests:
     * Binary generation for x86_64 platforms
     * GOOS and GOARCH compatibility checks
     * CGO_ENABLED configuration tests
     * Linker flag impact verification
   - Source installation process tests:
     * Installation from source on x86_64 systems
     * Makefile installation target verification
   - Build process validation:
     * Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) build tests
     * Binary size optimization tests
   - Platform-specific build tests:
     * x86_64 architecture support
     * 64-bit build tests

4. COMPLETE TODO LIST:
   A. Pre-Installation Preparation
   - Cross-compilation environment setup:
     * Verify Go installation (1.24+)
     * Configure cross-compilation tools
     * Set up GOOS and GOARCH environment
     * Prepare CGO configuration
   
   B. Installation Methods
   - Source installation process:
     * Clone repository
     * Verify Go version
     * Linux (Ubuntu) build method
     * Makefile installation
   - Cross-compilation strategies:
     * Support x86_64 target platforms
     * Configure environment variables
     * Optimize binary size
     * Test cross-compiled binaries
   
   C. Post-Installation Tasks
   - Verify installation
   - Run version check
   - Configure build environment
   - Set up cross-compilation capabilities
   - Document installation process
   - Perform compatibility tests

Key Adjustments:
- Focused on x86_64 architecture compatibility
- Removed Codespaces-specific configurations
- Streamlined package managers for x86_64
- Optimized for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS base image
- Leveraged large memory (187.5GB) for multi-stage builds
- Removed GPU-specific dependencies
- Aligned with Docker 28.3.2 BuildKit capabilities
