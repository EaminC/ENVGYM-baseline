=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   [Optimized for x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS]
   - Docker (28.3.2 compatible version)
   - Miniconda3 (x86_64 specific version)
   - Python 3.8 (recommended for compatibility)
   - OpenJDK 11 (stable version for x86_64)
   - Maven 3.8.6 
   - Multi-stage build optimization
   - Reduced dependency footprint

2. DOCKERFILE MODIFICATIONS:
   - Use ubuntu:22.04 as base image
   - Specify --platform linux/amd64 
   - Minimize layer count
   - Optimize for x86_64 architecture
   - Use multi-stage build strategy
   - Reduce image size by removing unnecessary dependencies

3. SYSTEM PREPARATION:
   - Confirm x86_64 system compatibility
   - Verify 16GB RAM minimum requirement
   - Allocate 20GB minimum disk space
   - Use standard container runtime
   - Configure sudo access carefully

4. ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION:
   - Working Directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/exli
   - Use BuildKit features for efficient builds
   - Configure Docker Compose v2.38.2 compatibility
   - Optimize conda environment for x86_64
   - Minimize Python library footprint

5. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - No GPU acceleration needed
   - Focus on CPU-based processing
   - Optimize for single-core/multi-core x86_64 processors
   - Reduce memory overhead
   - Streamline dependency management

6. INSTALLATION STRATEGY:
   - Prefer apt-get for system packages
   - Use pip with --no-cache-dir
   - Combine RUN commands to reduce layers
   - Use specific version pinning
   - Remove unnecessary development tools

7. SECURITY AND COMPATIBILITY:
   - Use official Docker images
   - Verify image signature
   - Limit container permissions
   - Use non-root user where possible
   - Implement minimal access principle

8. RECOMMENDED CHANGES:
   - Remove Mono compiler if not critically needed
   - Simplify Java library selections
   - Reduce Python library extras
   - Focus on core research dependencies
   - Remove optional IDE configurations

9. STORAGE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use volume mounting instead of large image layers
   - Implement .dockerignore 
   - Clean package manager caches
   - Remove unnecessary documentation

10. VERIFICATION MODIFICATIONS:
    - Simplified installation verification
    - Reduced test case complexity
    - Focus on core functionality testing
    - Minimal system requirement validation

KEY ADJUSTMENTS:
- Tailored for x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04
- Multi-stage, lean Docker build
- Minimized dependency footprint
- Optimized for limited storage
- BuildKit and Compose v2 compatible
- No GPU-specific configurations
