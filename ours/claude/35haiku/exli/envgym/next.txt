current progress
Docker build is failing during conda environment initialization, specifically in the RUN command that attempts to source conda configuration and create a research environment. The dockerfile follows the adjusted environment setup plan closely but encounters an execution error in the conda setup phase.

next step
Modify the conda installation RUN command to use shell-agnostic approach, potentially replacing `source` with explicit shell commands or using `conda run` syntax. Verify conda initialization method and ensure bash profile sourcing works correctly within Docker build context.
