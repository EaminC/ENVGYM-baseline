=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   - Docker (Latest stable version compatible with x86_64)
   - Golang (Version 1.20 or higher, x86_64 build)
   - Python (Version 3.10 or higher, preferably 3.12, x86_64 package)
   - Kind (v0.20.0, x86_64 binary)
   - kubectl (Latest stable version, x86_64 build)
   - [Optional] Helm (Latest stable version)
   - pip-tools
   - pre-commit
   - ansible-core (Version 2.17.5+)
   - Jinja2 (Version 3.1.4+)
   - CloudLab Account
   - xmlstarlet (for CloudLab profile configuration)
   - SSH Key Generation Tools
   - gocovmerge (for code coverage merging)
   - go tools cover (for code coverage analysis)

   [Rest of dependencies remain the same]

2. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
   - Leverage 96 logical cores for parallel builds and testing
   - Optimize Docker builds for x86_64 architecture
   - Configure build processes to utilize large memory (187.5GB)
   - Implement storage-efficient build strategies
   - Use --platform linux/amd64 for container builds
   - Configure Docker BuildKit for efficient multi-stage builds

3. STORAGE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Implement aggressive cache cleaning in Docker builds
   - Use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
   - Configure temporary build directories on larger partitions
   - Implement automated cleanup scripts for build artifacts
   - Set up disk usage monitoring in build scripts

4. DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT PATH ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Base working directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/acto
   - Ensure all script paths are relative to this base directory
   - Configure environment variables to reflect actual paths
   - Update all script references to use absolute paths
   - Create symlinks if necessary for tool accessibility

5. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:
   - Configure inotify limits to match high-performance environment
   - Set up Docker daemon to utilize multiple cores
   - Optimize Python and Go runtime settings for 96-core system
   - Configure memory allocation for Kubernetes and Kind clusters
   - Set up swap space management for complex builds

6. SECURITY AND ACCESS:
   - Generate SSH keys with strong encryption
   - Configure SSH config for CloudLab access
   - Set up secure, performance-optimized SSH connections
   - Implement key-based authentication
   - Configure firewall rules for development environment

7. PERFORMANCE TUNING:
   - Use parallel execution for pip and go package installations
   - Configure make and build tools for multi-core processing
   - Set up distributed caching for build artifacts
   - Implement concurrent testing strategies
   - Optimize CI/CD pipeline for high-core-count environment

8. COMPATIBILITY VERIFICATION:
   - Test all tools on x86_64 architecture
   - Verify cross-compilation support
   - Check binary compatibility with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
   - Validate tool versions against system capabilities
   - Perform comprehensive environment compatibility tests

9. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Use Docker BuildKit for efficient builds
   - Implement aggressive caching strategies
   - Configure Docker to use overlay2 storage driver
   - Set up container registry for internal artifact storage
   - Create development container with pre-configured environment

The rest of the original plan remains substantially unchanged, with these architectural and performance-specific modifications tailored to the x86_64 high-performance environment with 96 cores and 187.5GB RAM.
