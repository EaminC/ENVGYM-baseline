- Base Image: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Debian-based images compatible with x86_64
- GPU: No NVIDIA GPU detected, use standard base images without CUDA dependencies
- Instruction Notes: 
  * Large memory (187.5GB) allows complex multi-stage builds
  * High core count (96 logical cores) supports parallel build stages
  * Limited storage (59.4GB free) suggests minimizing image size
