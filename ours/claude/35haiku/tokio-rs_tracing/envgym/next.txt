current progress
Successfully created a Dockerfile for Rust development environment with x86_64 architecture support, installed Rust stable and nightly toolchains, added necessary build tools, configured environment variables, and completed an initial cargo build in release mode.

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by:
1. Consolidate RUN commands to reduce image layers
2. Add multi-stage build for smaller final image
3. Implement more granular dependency caching
4. Add explicit version pinning for installed packages
5. Consider adding health check or startup script
