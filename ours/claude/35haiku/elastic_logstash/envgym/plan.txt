=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   [Optimized for x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with 187.5GB RAM]
   - JDK (Adoptium) version 21.0.8 (Build 9) [x86_64 specific build]
   - JRuby version 9.4.13.0 (x86_64 compatible)
   - RVM (preferred over rbenv for x86_64)
   - Gradle build tool (version 8.1.1) 
   - Docker CE (version 28.3.2, matching detected version)
   - Python 3.9+ (recommended for Ubuntu 22.04)
   - All previous dependencies maintained

2. HARDWARE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS:
   - Adjust Docker build configurations for linux/amd64 platform
   - Leverage large RAM (187.5GB) for:
     * Multi-stage builds
     * Parallel dependency downloads
     * Increased build cache
     * Enhanced compilation optimization
   - Configure build processes to utilize multiple CPU cores
   - Increase default heap and build memory allocations

3. STORAGE AND PATH ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Base working directory: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/elastic_logstash
   - Create dedicated build cache: /home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/logstash_build_cache
   - Configure Gradle to use local build cache
   - Set temporary directory with sufficient space
   - Configure Docker to use overlay2 storage driver

4. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Enable BuildKit for advanced Docker builds
   - Configure Gradle daemon for faster builds
   - Set aggressive compilation flags for x86_64
   - Optimize JVM settings for large memory environment
   - Configure parallel processing for dependency resolution

5. COMPATIBILITY CHECKS:
   - Verify x86_64 compatibility for all downloaded tools
   - Test Docker builds specifically for amd64 platform
   - Ensure Ubuntu 22.04 LTS package compatibility
   - Validate software versions against system architecture

6. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use official x86_64 images from trusted sources
   - Configure SELinux/AppArmor for container isolation
   - Implement strict volume mounting practices
   - Use latest security patches for Ubuntu 22.04

7. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Use Docker Compose for complex multi-container setups
   - Implement volume management for persistent data
   - Configure network isolation and port mapping
   - Set up comprehensive logging mechanisms

The core setup plan remains largely unchanged, with optimizations specifically tailored to the x86_64 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment with extensive RAM and the latest Docker version.

Key Adjustments:
- Platform-specific builds
- Leveraging large memory
- Optimized build processes
- Enhanced Docker configuration
- Architectural compatibility verification
