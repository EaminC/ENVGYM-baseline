current progress
Successfully created a comprehensive Dockerfile for Logstash development environment on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with x86_64 architecture. Integrated multiple tools including RVM, JRuby, Gradle, Docker CE, and Python 3.9. Configured performance optimizations, build caching, and repository cloning with error handling. Previous Docker execution was successful.

next step
Enhance Docker build by:
1. Add explicit version pinning for all installed packages
2. Implement multi-stage build for reduced image size
3. Configure non-root user for improved security
4. Add explicit health checks and startup scripts
5. Optimize layer caching with more strategic RUN commands
