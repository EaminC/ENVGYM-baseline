current progress
Dockerfile successfully configured for CPU-based environment with Python 3.10.12, Ubuntu 22.04, and necessary build dependencies. Virtual environment created, PyTorch CPU version installed, and basic package requirements met.

next step
Optimize Dockerfile by:
1. Consolidate RUN commands to reduce image layers
2. Add clean-up commands to reduce image size
3. Implement multi-stage build to minimize final image size
4. Add explicit version pinning for critical dependencies
5. Configure non-root user for enhanced security
