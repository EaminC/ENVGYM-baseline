=== ADJUSTED ENVIRONMENT SETUP PLAN ===

1. DOWNLOADS NEEDED:
   [Unchanged, but with specific version considerations for x86_64 architecture]
   - Node.js (v14+ LTS version, x86_64 compatible)
   - npm (bundled with Node.js)
   - Git (x86_64 version)
   - VSCode (x86_64 binary)
   - Chrome/Firefox (x86_64 builds)

2. DOCKER CONFIGURATION:
   - Base Image: `node:alpine` (lightweight, x86_64 compatible)
   - Multi-stage build recommended
   - Create `.dockerignore` to optimize build context
   - Dockerfile optimizations:
     * Use `--platform=linux/amd64`
     * Minimize layer count
     * Use Alpine Linux for smaller image size
     * Leverage BuildKit features

3. ENVIRONMENT ADJUSTMENTS:
   - Working Directory: `/home/cc/EnvGym/data-gpt-4.1mini/iamkun_dayjs`
   - Ensure all paths are absolute
   - Use volume mounting for persistent data
   - Configure CPU-based testing (no GPU acceleration)

4. PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Use lightweight testing frameworks
   - Optimize Rollup and Babel configurations for x86_64
   - Disable GPU-specific plugins
   - Configure memory limits in Docker (recommend 2-4GB)

5. TOOLCHAIN UPDATES:
   - Verify x86_64 compatibility of:
     * Karma
     * Rollup
     * TypeScript
     * Babel
     * ESLint
   - Use npm or Yarn for package management
   - Prefer Alpine-compatible global installations

6. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Focus on CPU-based cross-browser testing
   - Use Sauce Labs with x86_64 browser configurations
   - Implement lightweight CI/CD pipeline
   - Optimize test matrix for x86_64 architecture

7. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Ensure documentation tools are x86_64 compatible
   - Use static site generators optimized for performance
   - Configure day.js.org deployment for x86_64 environments

8. SECURITY AND OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use `node:alpine` slim images
   - Implement multi-stage Docker builds
   - Minimize container image size
   - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
   - Configure non-root user in Docker container

9. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
   - Travis CI configuration updated for x86_64
   - Leverage Docker BuildKit features
   - Optimize CI/CD pipeline for x86_64 architecture

10. STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE:
    - Allocate sufficient disk space (10-20GB recommended)
    - Use Docker volume management
    - Configure caching strategies for npm/Yarn
    - Implement efficient build caching

KEY MODIFICATIONS:
- Switched to `node:alpine` base image
- Optimized for x86_64 architecture
- Lightweight, minimalist approach
- Enhanced Docker configuration
- CPU-focused testing strategy
- Reduced image and build complexity

Verification Method:
- `docker build --platform=linux/amd64 .`
- `npm run test:ci`
- `npm run docs:build`
- Comprehensive architecture compatibility checks
