Basic Ubuntu-based Docker environment set up with Python, Jupyter, and data science libraries installed. Dockerfile successfully builds and runs.

next step
Add more specific machine learning or environment-specific libraries like tensorflow, pytorch, or gym. Consider adding specific version pinning for reproducibility and adding a default command or startup script.
